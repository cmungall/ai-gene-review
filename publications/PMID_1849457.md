cdc28-1N is a conditional allele that has normal G1 (Start) function but confers 
a mitotic defect. We have isolated seven genes that in high dosage suppress the 
growth defect of cdc28-1N cells but not of Start-defective cdc28-4 cells. Three 
of these (CLB1, CLB2, and CLB4) encode proteins strongly homologous to 
G2-specific B-type cyclins. Another gene, CLB3, was cloned using PCR, CLB1 and 
CLB2 encode a pair of closely related proteins; CLB3 and CLB4 encode a second 
pair. Neither CLB1 nor CLB2 is essential; however, disruption of both is lethal 
and causes a mitotic defect. Furthermore, the double mutant cdc28-1N clb2::LEU2 
is nonviable, whereas cdc28-4 clb2::LEU2 is viable, suggesting that the cdc28-1N 
protein may be defective in its interaction with B-type cyclins. Our results are 
consistent with CDC28 function being required in both G1 and mitosis. Its 
mitotic role, we believe, involves interaction with a family of at least four 
G2-specific cyclins.

IntroductionEukaryotic genomes contain innumerable origins of DNA replication, where DNA synthesis initiates, distributed along chromosomes to replicate the genome.1,2 Origins are activated in two steps, which are mutually exclusive in the cell cycle to prevent re-replication.3,4 In the G1 phase, origins are licensed as potential replication initiation sites when the ORC complex, the Cdc6 protein, and the Cdt1 chaperone recruit inactive double hexamers of the MCM2-7 helicase around dsDNA at the origins.5 Next, in the S phase, initiation of DNA synthesis at licensed origins, or origin firing, occurs after additional initiation and elongation factors are recruited to double hexamers.6,7 This results in the formation of two mature Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) replicative helicases per fired origin, within two active replisomes.4,8 As a result, fired origins are delicensed, and sister replisomes together with their associated replication forks progress away from the origin producing a DNA replication bubble. Chromosomal replication terminates when opposing replisomes meet.6,9 During S phase, the activation of multiple origins enables simultaneous DNA replication at multiple replicons, together ensuring timely replication completion of all genomic regions.4CDK activity regulates the timing of origin activation within the cell cycle.10 For the M/G1 phase transition, the APC/C-Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase targets mitotic cyclins for degradation to inactivate M-CDK.11 At this time, the expression of the yeast CDK inhibitor (CKI) of Cdc28-Clb kinases turns mitotic exit irreversible.12,13 In the G1 phase, Sic1 inhibits S-CDK to control the G1/S transition.14,15 From yeast to mammals, the G1 phase remains stable as long as APC/C-Cdh1, CKIs, and negative CDK feedback loops keep M-, G1-, and S-phase CDK activities low.16,17 In budding yeast, proliferation signaling can activate G1-CDK. This triggers positive G1-and S-CDK feedback loops that lead to APC/C-Cdh1 inactivation and Sic1 degradation in late G1 to induce timely G1/S transition.18,19,20 This regulation of CDK confines licensing to G1 phase, firing to S phase, and impedes both during the G1/S transition because CDKs inhibit origin licensing while S-CDK is required for origin firing.3,21 This control determines that each licensed origin available for firing during S phase is established in the preceding G1 phase. Therefore, the regulation of CDK in G1 phase should prevent genomic regions from being depleted of licensed origins.Numerous origins initiate DNA synthesis throughout the genome during S phase from yeast to human cells.22,23 Other licensed origins remain unfired, or dormant, to be passively replicated by ongoing replisomes.24,25 MCM double hexamers temporarily pause the progression of replication forks and the associated replisomes.26,27 At the replisome, the Tof1 and Csm3 subunits are necessary for pausing, while the Rrm3 helicase facilitates replication fork movement through unfired origins.26,27 Unfired MCM double hexamers at dormant origins can be removed from replicating DNA by progressing replisomes and the Pif1 helicase.28 Analysis of individual yeast origins shows that no origin is active in every S phase,29 and metazoan cells also vary the use of replication origins.30 Consistently, the most active budding yeast origins on a chromosome, or up to 95% of chromatin-loaded metazoan MCM2-7, are dispensable for bulk genome duplication under unperturbed replication conditions.31,32,33,34 However, this origin excess is necessary under exogenous replication stress (i.e., slowing or stalling of replication forks35) to maintain genome stability, likely serving as a backup of dormant origins that fire to rescue delayed replication.36 This shows that eukaryotic genomes display an origin redundancy, comprising active and dormant origins, which is dispensable during unperturbed replication but necessary under replication stress. Since origins contribute to genomic replication only within their local chromosomal surroundings, each genomic region should possess sufficient origin redundancy to prevent local replication completion problems.37 Heterogeneous reduction of origin redundancy throughout the genome has thus the potential to affect genomic regions unevenly.A mild reduction in MCM2-7 levels might induce this effect under unperturbed replication conditions. In mammals, uneven fork stalling, under-replication, mitotic chromosome aberrations, mis-segregation, and micronuclei have been observed throughout the genome.34,38,39,40,41,42 These defects correlate with preferential instability at specific chromosomal regions, such us fragile sites, late replicating regions, or the ribosomal DNA (rDNA).38,41,43,44 Yeast cells recapitulate the heterogeneous effects of MCM2-7 reduction seen in metazoans,45 including enriched chromosomal aberrations at specific genomic elements such as Ty retrotransposon elements, tRNAs, rDNA, or replication termination sites.45,46,47 Importantly, partial mutation or depletion of MCM2-7 in budding yeast induces uneven reduction in licensing and firing between origins, leading to replication delays in regions with fewer origins.48,49,50 Thus, reduction of the licensing machinery has the potential to provide an unchecked mechanism for irregular instability between genomic regions by inducing uneven origin deprivation.CDK phosphorylation of licensing proteins, including the MCM2-7 complex, inhibits origin licensing.21,51 Full inhibition can be reached under high CDK activity,52 while a moderate increase of CDK complexes during G1 phase only partially limits licensing.53 From yeast to human cells, direct or indirect CDK upregulation in G1 phase triggers origin under-licensing, reducing the number of licensed origins available for firing during S phase.15,53,54,55 Additionally, G1 phase CDK upregulation can induce other potential causes of replication stress and chromosomal instability, particularly in mammalian cells.56,57,58 All these defects correlate with non-uniform patterns of replication stress, aberrant mitosis, and chromosomal instability across the genome. For instance, mammalian cyclin E overexpression, a common oncogenic activation in human cancers, induces stalling or collapse of a proportion of replication forks,59,60,61,62 and specific genomic regions exhibit higher under-replication, mitotic DNA synthesis, aberrant segregation, and instability.63,64,65 In budding yeast, Sic1 loss induces increased inter-origin distances at a subset of replicons and delayed segregation of late-replicating subtelomeric regions.15 The mechanism by which CDK upregulation in G1 phase can induce such heterogeneous consequences across the genome remains unclear. It could arise from the irregular merge of all or part of the defects caused by CDK upregulation between chromosomal regions. Alternatively, a single defect may be sufficient to induce a bias in instability across the genome. Importantly, upregulation of CDK activation in budding yeast during G1 phase could reduce the number of licensed origin available for firing in S phase, in a non-uniform manner across chromosomal regions, potentially resulting in heterogeneous effects throughout the genome. Loss of the CDK inactivators Cdh1 or Sic1 in G1 phase leads to an irregular reduction of activity between origins.15,66 Sic1 depletion reduces firing efficiency of 40% of studied individual origins, and to varying degrees between them.66 Origin sensitivity to Sic1 depletion is independent of their normal efficiency, firing timing, or chromosomal location.66 Instead, sensitivity is likely due to reduced licensing caused by the absence of Cdc6 protein in late G1, as a consequence of premature S-CDK activation.15 Restricting origin licensing to late G1 by expressing CDC6 under the control of the HO promoter is lethal in sic1Δ cells; however, this lethality can be rescued by deletion of the S-CDK cyclin-coding genes CLB5 and CLB6.15 Therefore, premature S-CDK activation in late G1 in sic1Δ cells impede licensing just before G1 exit. sic1-sensitive origins would be likely those that depend on the late G1 wave of Cdc6 synthesis for full licensing. This suggests that deficient CDK inactivation during G1 phase can unevenly reduce origin activity, potentially leading to heterogeneous replication and stability defects across the genome. However, this mechanism remains unexplored.Here, we examined the consequences of irregular origin activity reduction induced by Sic1 depletion on the replication and stability of two chromosomal regions. We studied the relationship between the regional firing activities of individual origins, the dynamics of DNA synthesis completion by the end of S phase, and the rate of gross chromosomal rearrangements in these two regions. Our data show that the number of origins rendered deficient by Sic1 loss in each region directly impacts on DNA synthesis completion and instability rates. The most unstable region, the left arm of chromosome V, exhibited a concentration of deficient active and dormant origins, compromising origin redundancy, timely DNA synthesis completion, stability, and tolerance to local replication stress. A delay in mitosis entry was sufficient to suppress instability, independently of origin redundancy deficiency, highlighting the mechanism underlying chromosomal instability. In contrast, the second region studied, the left arm of chromosome III, displayed only a deficient active origin. This resulted in minor defects in under-replication and instability in this region. We propose that CDK inhibition by the Sic1 protein during G1 phase prevents specific genomic regions from origin depletion, deficient replication, and instability.

Introduction

Eukaryotic genomes contain innumerable origins of DNA replication, where DNA synthesis initiates, distributed along chromosomes to replicate the genome.1,2 Origins are activated in two steps, which are mutually exclusive in the cell cycle to prevent re-replication.3,4 In the G1 phase, origins are licensed as potential replication initiation sites when the ORC complex, the Cdc6 protein, and the Cdt1 chaperone recruit inactive double hexamers of the MCM2-7 helicase around dsDNA at the origins.5 Next, in the S phase, initiation of DNA synthesis at licensed origins, or origin firing, occurs after additional initiation and elongation factors are recruited to double hexamers.6,7 This results in the formation of two mature Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) replicative helicases per fired origin, within two active replisomes.4,8 As a result, fired origins are delicensed, and sister replisomes together with their associated replication forks progress away from the origin producing a DNA replication bubble. Chromosomal replication terminates when opposing replisomes meet.6,9 During S phase, the activation of multiple origins enables simultaneous DNA replication at multiple replicons, together ensuring timely replication completion of all genomic regions.4

CDK activity regulates the timing of origin activation within the cell cycle.10 For the M/G1 phase transition, the APC/C-Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase targets mitotic cyclins for degradation to inactivate M-CDK.11 At this time, the expression of the yeast CDK inhibitor (CKI) of Cdc28-Clb kinases turns mitotic exit irreversible.12,13 In the G1 phase, Sic1 inhibits S-CDK to control the G1/S transition.14,15 From yeast to mammals, the G1 phase remains stable as long as APC/C-Cdh1, CKIs, and negative CDK feedback loops keep M-, G1-, and S-phase CDK activities low.16,17 In budding yeast, proliferation signaling can activate G1-CDK. This triggers positive G1-and S-CDK feedback loops that lead to APC/C-Cdh1 inactivation and Sic1 degradation in late G1 to induce timely G1/S transition.18,19,20 This regulation of CDK confines licensing to G1 phase, firing to S phase, and impedes both during the G1/S transition because CDKs inhibit origin licensing while S-CDK is required for origin firing.3,21 This control determines that each licensed origin available for firing during S phase is established in the preceding G1 phase. Therefore, the regulation of CDK in G1 phase should prevent genomic regions from being depleted of licensed origins.

Numerous origins initiate DNA synthesis throughout the genome during S phase from yeast to human cells.22,23 Other licensed origins remain unfired, or dormant, to be passively replicated by ongoing replisomes.24,25 MCM double hexamers temporarily pause the progression of replication forks and the associated replisomes.26,27 At the replisome, the Tof1 and Csm3 subunits are necessary for pausing, while the Rrm3 helicase facilitates replication fork movement through unfired origins.26,27 Unfired MCM double hexamers at dormant origins can be removed from replicating DNA by progressing replisomes and the Pif1 helicase.28 Analysis of individual yeast origins shows that no origin is active in every S phase,29 and metazoan cells also vary the use of replication origins.30 Consistently, the most active budding yeast origins on a chromosome, or up to 95% of chromatin-loaded metazoan MCM2-7, are dispensable for bulk genome duplication under unperturbed replication conditions.31,32,33,34 However, this origin excess is necessary under exogenous replication stress (i.e., slowing or stalling of replication forks35) to maintain genome stability, likely serving as a backup of dormant origins that fire to rescue delayed replication.36 This shows that eukaryotic genomes display an origin redundancy, comprising active and dormant origins, which is dispensable during unperturbed replication but necessary under replication stress. Since origins contribute to genomic replication only within their local chromosomal surroundings, each genomic region should possess sufficient origin redundancy to prevent local replication completion problems.37 Heterogeneous reduction of origin redundancy throughout the genome has thus the potential to affect genomic regions unevenly.

A mild reduction in MCM2-7 levels might induce this effect under unperturbed replication conditions. In mammals, uneven fork stalling, under-replication, mitotic chromosome aberrations, mis-segregation, and micronuclei have been observed throughout the genome.34,38,39,40,41,42 These defects correlate with preferential instability at specific chromosomal regions, such us fragile sites, late replicating regions, or the ribosomal DNA (rDNA).38,41,43,44 Yeast cells recapitulate the heterogeneous effects of MCM2-7 reduction seen in metazoans,45 including enriched chromosomal aberrations at specific genomic elements such as Ty retrotransposon elements, tRNAs, rDNA, or replication termination sites.45,46,47 Importantly, partial mutation or depletion of MCM2-7 in budding yeast induces uneven reduction in licensing and firing between origins, leading to replication delays in regions with fewer origins.48,49,50 Thus, reduction of the licensing machinery has the potential to provide an unchecked mechanism for irregular instability between genomic regions by inducing uneven origin deprivation.

CDK phosphorylation of licensing proteins, including the MCM2-7 complex, inhibits origin licensing.21,51 Full inhibition can be reached under high CDK activity,52 while a moderate increase of CDK complexes during G1 phase only partially limits licensing.53 From yeast to human cells, direct or indirect CDK upregulation in G1 phase triggers origin under-licensing, reducing the number of licensed origins available for firing during S phase.15,53,54,55 Additionally, G1 phase CDK upregulation can induce other potential causes of replication stress and chromosomal instability, particularly in mammalian cells.56,57,58 All these defects correlate with non-uniform patterns of replication stress, aberrant mitosis, and chromosomal instability across the genome. For instance, mammalian cyclin E overexpression, a common oncogenic activation in human cancers, induces stalling or collapse of a proportion of replication forks,59,60,61,62 and specific genomic regions exhibit higher under-replication, mitotic DNA synthesis, aberrant segregation, and instability.63,64,65 In budding yeast, Sic1 loss induces increased inter-origin distances at a subset of replicons and delayed segregation of late-replicating subtelomeric regions.15 The mechanism by which CDK upregulation in G1 phase can induce such heterogeneous consequences across the genome remains unclear. It could arise from the irregular merge of all or part of the defects caused by CDK upregulation between chromosomal regions. Alternatively, a single defect may be sufficient to induce a bias in instability across the genome. Importantly, upregulation of CDK activation in budding yeast during G1 phase could reduce the number of licensed origin available for firing in S phase, in a non-uniform manner across chromosomal regions, potentially resulting in heterogeneous effects throughout the genome. Loss of the CDK inactivators Cdh1 or Sic1 in G1 phase leads to an irregular reduction of activity between origins.15,66 Sic1 depletion reduces firing efficiency of 40% of studied individual origins, and to varying degrees between them.66 Origin sensitivity to Sic1 depletion is independent of their normal efficiency, firing timing, or chromosomal location.66 Instead, sensitivity is likely due to reduced licensing caused by the absence of Cdc6 protein in late G1, as a consequence of premature S-CDK activation.15 Restricting origin licensing to late G1 by expressing CDC6 under the control of the HO promoter is lethal in sic1Δ cells; however, this lethality can be rescued by deletion of the S-CDK cyclin-coding genes CLB5 and CLB6.15 Therefore, premature S-CDK activation in late G1 in sic1Δ cells impede licensing just before G1 exit. sic1-sensitive origins would be likely those that depend on the late G1 wave of Cdc6 synthesis for full licensing. This suggests that deficient CDK inactivation during G1 phase can unevenly reduce origin activity, potentially leading to heterogeneous replication and stability defects across the genome. However, this mechanism remains unexplored.

Here, we examined the consequences of irregular origin activity reduction induced by Sic1 depletion on the replication and stability of two chromosomal regions. We studied the relationship between the regional firing activities of individual origins, the dynamics of DNA synthesis completion by the end of S phase, and the rate of gross chromosomal rearrangements in these two regions. Our data show that the number of origins rendered deficient by Sic1 loss in each region directly impacts on DNA synthesis completion and instability rates. The most unstable region, the left arm of chromosome V, exhibited a concentration of deficient active and dormant origins, compromising origin redundancy, timely DNA synthesis completion, stability, and tolerance to local replication stress. A delay in mitosis entry was sufficient to suppress instability, independently of origin redundancy deficiency, highlighting the mechanism underlying chromosomal instability. In contrast, the second region studied, the left arm of chromosome III, displayed only a deficient active origin. This resulted in minor defects in under-replication and instability in this region. We propose that CDK inhibition by the Sic1 protein during G1 phase prevents specific genomic regions from origin depletion, deficient replication, and instability.

ResultsSic1 depletion decreases origin redundancy in left chromosome V arm to induce most local gross chromosomal rearrangementsTo examine whether differential origin reduction is linked to uneven instability between genomic regions under Sic1 loss, we first studied how the activity of likely or confirmed origins67 affects the rate of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) (measured as the probability of simultaneous loss of URA3 and CAN1 genes per cell generation) in the left arm of budding yeast chromosome V (ChrV-L)68 (Figure 1A). In this region, reduced redundancy between the early-replicating origin of DNA replication ARS507 and the late/dormant origin ARS504.2 correlates with an elevated ChrV-L GCR rate in cells lacking the Sic1 protein, suggesting a direct link between these defects.15,66,68,69 In further support, increased origin density in ChrV-L reverses local GCR rates under deregulation of yeast G1-cyclin expression.53 To analyze this link, we repressed Sic1 protein expression by placing the endogenous SIC1 gene under the GAL1,10 promoter and switching GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells from galactose-to glucose-based rich media for 4 h. This reduced Sic1 protein levels by 95% compared to cells with wild-type Sic1 expression (Sic1 wt) (Figure 1B), decreased G1-phase cell number (Figure 1C), and increased ChrV-L GCR rates by 23-fold (Figure 1D, see Table S1). To analyze the activity of individual origins, we used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (2D gels), which separates replication bubbles (B) from single forks (Y) in chromosomal DNA fragments containing an origin (Figure 1E).70 The relative signal of B- and Y-arcs reflects qualitative variations in origin efficiency (Figure 1E). By this analysis, we reproduced that Sic1-depletion reduced ARS507 activity, while ARS508 remained unaffected66 (Figure 1F, see Figure S1). Semiquantitative analysis of arc signals can estimate origin efficiency as the percentage of bubbles in total replication intermediates.29,71 Biological triplicates of 2D gels of DNA fragments from asynchronous Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells were analyzed (Figure 1F, see Figure S1) (the analysis of ARS507 is shown as an example in Figure S2). Sic1 depletion halved ARS507 activity (bubble %, mean ± sd, Sic1 wt, 62 ± 4; Sic1 depletion, 34 ± 7; t-test p value < 0.001572), while ARS508 remained nearly unaffected (bubble %, Sic1 wt, 65 ± 1; Sic1 depletion, 62 ± 4; t-test p value < 0,145840), and the other origins remained inactive (undetected B arcs in these conditions). Consequently, depletion of Sic1 led to a 25% decrease in replication origin firing activity across all origins (50% of ARS507 and 95% of ARS508) within this chromosomal region.Figure 1Sic1 depletion decreases origin redundancy in left chromosome V arm to induce most local GCR rate(A) Map of the first 100 kilobases of ChrV-L showing to scale the major known or likely ARS loci, the SIT1 gene (see (J)), and the genes relevant for the GCR assay in this region (URA3 and CAN1 markers, and the first essential gene from TEL05L, PCM1) (see (D)).(B) Western blots showing Sic1 protein levels in asynchronous control cells (Sic1 wt) growing for 4 h in glucose-based YPAD media, or in asynchronous GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells after Sic1 depletion (4 h, YPAD) or induction (galactose media, YPARG) conditions (n = 3).

The precise substitution of ARS507 DNA by a DNA segment of identical length containing ARS305 (a Sic1 depletion-resistant origin) (ars507Δ-ARS305) nearly restores wild-type firing at this locus under Sic1 loss.66
Figure 1G shows that ars507Δ-ARS305 maintained a similar efficiency to ARS507 in Sic1 wt cells (bubble %, 68 ± 6; t-test p value < 0.096973), without significantly altering the ChrV-L GCR rate (p value 0.3815) (Figure 1D). In Sic1 depleted cells, ars507Δ-ARS305 restored 95% of wild-type ARS507 activity (bubble %, 59 ± 6; t-test p value < 0.06288) (Figure 1G), to significantly reduce the local GCR rate to one-third (p value 0.0002) (Figure 1D). This indicates that ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion is responsible for most ChrV-L rearrangements. We reasoned that if the ChrV-L GCR rate directly reflects the extent of ARS507 deficiency, increased ARS507 deficiency should exacerbate the GCR rate. Indeed, ARS507 deletion (ars507Δ) abolished firing in this locus in both Sic1 wt and Sic1 depletion conditions (Figure 1H). Importantly, the ChrV-L GCR rate in Sic1 depleted cells significantly increased up to 80-fold (p value 0.0158) (Figure 1D) in contrast to Sic1 wt cells (p value 0.7924). We conclude that Sic1 loss mainly destabilizes ChrV-L by affecting ARS507.ars507Δ mutation in Sic1 wt cells was accompanied by appearance of subtle, but reproducible, bubble arcs at ARS504.2 and proARS506 origins after overexposing 2D gels (bubble %, ARS504.2, 2.6 ± 0.2; proARS506, 3.2 ± 1.2) (note that blot overexposure to highlight signal of weak bubble arcs alters the view of the signal but not the underlying data for quantification (see STAR Methods)) (Figure 1H). This showed backup firing at these thereby dormant origins. This confirms the likely proARS506 as an active origin, and thus we renamed it as ARS506 and confirmed activity of ARS504.2 (here, renamed as ARS505 for consistency). In contrast, Sic1-depleted ars507Δ cells showed significant backup firing deficiency at the dormant ARS505 and ARS506 origins (bubble %, ARS505, 1 ± 0.4, p < 0.014369; ARS506, 1.6 ± 0.7, p value < 0.045692) (Figure 1H). This revealed these dormant origins are deficient under Sic1 depletion. This deficiency may explain the lack of backup response from these origins to ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion (Figure 1F), suggesting that deficient origin backup could contribute to ChrV-L GCRs. This is consistent with the concurrent loss of flanking active and dormant origins being necessary to induce instability of the left arm of chromosome III in wild-type yeast cells.33 To assess the contribution of dormant origin deficiency to ChrV-L GCR rate under Sic1 depletion, we removed or added dormant origins. To remove dormant origins, we deleted ARS505. Since no firing was detected at ARS505 (Figure 1F), ars505Δ produced no effect in 2D gels (Figure 1I). Sic1 wt ars505Δ cells showed no statistical GCR rate variation (p value 0.7), but Sic1-depleted ars505Δ cells exhibited a significant GCR rate increase up to 75-fold (p value 0.0081) (Figure 1D). This suggests that certain backup firing activity, undetected in ARS505 2D gels, could be lost in ars505Δ, contributing to local instability under Sic1 depletion. This also suggests that loss of dormant origins at ChrV-L is sufficient to aggravate instability in the context of Sic1-depletion deficient ARS507. To test this, we added extra origins to the region by inserting either an empty plasmid (sit1-empty) or the same plasmid containing a cluster of seven ARS209 Sic1 depletion-resistant origins (sit1-ARS209(7X)) at the SIT1 locus (Figure 1A). Sic1 wt cells showed no firing activity at sit1-empty and only a very weak signal at sit1-ARS209(7X) (see histograms in Figure 1J), consistent with statistically invariant ChrV-L GCR rates (sit1-empty p value 0.7555; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value 0.9126) (Figure 1D). In contrast, ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion triggered backup firing at sit1-ARS209(7X) (bubble %, 4.0 ± 0.2, t-test p value p < 0.016430) (Figure 1H), resulting in a significant reduction of the ChrV-L GCR rate to one-third (sit1-empty p value 0.5214; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value 0.0037) (Figure 1D). This shows that deficient backup firing from dormant origins in response to ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion induced ChrV-L instability.These data show that restoring either active or dormant origin efficiency under Sic1 loss similarly reduced most, but not all, GCR ChrV-L rates. However, combining ars507Δ-ARS305 and sit1-ARS209(7X) in Sic1-depleted cells did not further reduce GCR rates beyond the effect of each construct by separate (Figure 1D). Thereby, restoring the firing of either origin type was sufficient to suppress most instability under Sic1 loss, indicating redundancy between these origins. Nonetheless, one-third of the instability induced by Sic1 depletion in ChrV-L persisted, suggesting that other deficiencies caused by Sic1 loss may also contribute to instability. These could include reduced activity of additional origins on chromosome V, like ARS506, or origin-unrelated defects. Taken together, these data show that Sic1 depletion reduces the activity of both active and dormant neighboring origins, compromising local origin redundancy, and inducing most instability in the left arm of chromosome V.Deficient origin activity under Sic1 loss does not induce S-phase checkpoint activation or sensitivity to exogenous replication stressThis significant contribution of origin deficiency to genomic instability prompted us to further investigate the underlying mechanism. Upregulation of CDK activity by oncogene activation leads to DNA replication stress and activation of the replication and DNA damage checkpoints in the path to genome instability during tumorigenesis.59,72 Replication stress poses a threat to genomic stability in normal and cancer cells.35,57 We wondered whether deficient origin redundancy by Sic1 depletion could similarly induce replication stress to levels activating the replication checkpoint response. In budding yeast, replication stress is detected as DNA gaps containing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which are recognized by the ssDNA-binding heterotrimeric Replication Protein A (RPA, composed of Rfa1, Rfa2, and Rfa3 subunits).73 The ssDNA-RPA complex recruits the ATRIP homolog Ddc2, which subsequently attracts and helps to activate the checkpoint sensor kinase Mec1. This leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the effector Rad53 kinase, initiating the checkpoint response.74 This leads to downstream events including stabilization of stalled forks and inhibition of new origin firing events.75,76 To assess checkpoint activation as a proxy of endogenous replication stress in Sic1 depleted cells, we quantified the levels of DNA-bound Rfa1 associated with sites of DNA synthesis during early S phase. To synchronize cells in early S-phase under Sic1 wt or Sic1 depletion conditions, we treated Sic1 wt and GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells containing Rfa1-9xPK-tagged protein and 7 copies of the thymidine kinase TK+ (7xTK+), enabling BrdU incorporation into nascent DNA,77 as shown in Figure 2A. In summary, repression of GAL1,10p-SIC1 in cells arrested in G2/M, followed by a telophase block-and-release using the cdc15-2 thermosensitive mutation, triggered synchronous cell progression through G1 and S phases (Figure 2Ai), and Sic1 depletion during telophase and G1 phase in GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells (Figure 2Aii). At 40 min post-release, we performed BrdU-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by real-time qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) to identify chromosomal DNA synthesis at this time-point. Figure 2Aiii shows BrdU incorporation at the early-replicating origins ARS305, ARS306, ARS507, and ARS508, while the late replicating subtelomeric origin ARS300 showed low BrdU incorporation. We detected no significant variation of BrdU abundance at these loci between Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells under these conditions. We then quantified the relative Rfa1-9xPK enrichment at these early-replicating origins after Rfa1-9xPK ChIP-qPCR (Figure 2Aiv). Importantly, we observed no variation in Rfa1 levels between Sic1-depleted and Sic1 wt cells, suggesting that Sic1 depletion do not increase RPA at replication forks during S phase. We also monitored Rad53 phosphorylation and Rad53 kinase activity. Immunoblot analysis of Rad53 did not evidence phosphorylated Rad53 under Sic1 depletion, and in situ kinase assay did not reveal Rad53 autophosphorylation (Figure 2B), indicating absence of S phase checkpoint activation in these conditions. This cannot be attributed to checkpoint activation deficiency under Sic1 depletion, as exogenous replication stress induced by hydroxyurea (HU), the inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, activated Rad53 kinase to similar levels in Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells (Figure 2A). Consistent with this lack of checkpoint activation, Sic1-depleted cells did not require Mec1 or Rad53 for viability (Figure 2C). These data strongly suggest that Sic1 depletion does not trigger endogenous replication stress to levels activating the checkpoint, ruling out a putative implication in genomic instability. The lack of checkpoint activation also discards that origin deficiency in Sic1 lacking cells is due to checkpoint-dependent inhibition of origin firing.Figure 2Deficient origin activity under Sic1 loss does not induce S-phase checkpoint activation or sensitivity to exogenous replication stress(A) cdc15-2 block-and-release experiment for synchronous progression of Sic1 wt and GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells of the indicated genotype through G1 and S phases.

Figure 2D shows that cell viability was not perturbed by Sic1 loss in these conditions. These data show that reduction of origin activity due to Sic1 depletion does not sensitize cells to exogenous replication stress.Dormant origin deficiency under Sic1 loss renders ChrV-L stability sensitive to delayed local replicationUnaffected cell viability under Sic1 depletion, even in presence of exogenous replication stress, could reflect the partial firing deficiency at a subset of origins due to Sic1 loss.66 As a result, specific genomic regions rather than the genome globally, can be affected. To test whether deficient origin redundancy in ChrV-L compromises the response to local replication stress, we aimed to induce replication stress in this region. Fork pausing at natural protein-DNA fork barriers present in the genome is a source of localized replication stress that delay replication by halting replisome progression.35 In budding yeast, each rDNA repeat contains such replication fork barriers (RFB), which pause forks in a polar manner that is detected by 2D gels78 (see Figure S3A). This RFB can be inserted into a specific genomic locus outside the rDNA in the form of a “RFB cassette” (see Figure S3A) to transiently pause replication outside the rDNA without triggering a cellular checkpoint response.27 We confirmed that fork pausing at protein-DNA fork barriers is independent of Sic1 protein, as forks efficiently paused under Sic1 depletion at the rDNA RFB (t-test p value < 0.474263) or at pre-replication complexes at licensed origins like the Sic1 depletion-resistant ARS522 origin (t-test p value < 0.097221) (see Figure S3B). We used that RFB cassette as a tool to induce directional slow-down of DNA replication in ChrV-L, by inserting it in ChrV-L positioned to halt forks progressing toward the telomere, the main replication direction in this region79 (Figure 3A; see Figure S3C). 2D gels show that forks efficiently paused at the ChrV-L-RFB locus to similar levels in Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted asynchronous cells (p value < 0.397991) (Figure 3B), without affecting cell viability (see Figure S3D). In Sic1 wt cells, this triggered backup firing of the downstream dormant ARS505 and ARS506 origins (bubble %, ARS505, 1.5 ± 0.6; ARS506, 1.4 ± 0.2) (Figure 3C). Despite this, the local GCR rate increased significantly (p value < 0.0001) by 19-fold (Figure 3D), showing that strong fork pausing induces genomic instability in wt cells. The insertion of extra dormant origins at the SIT1 locus, sit1-ARS209(7X), but not the insertion of the control sit1-empty sequence, produced backup firing (bubble %, 8.2 ± 2.4) (Figure 3E), and significantly reduced the local GCR rate by 3-fold (sit1-empty p value 0.6172; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value < 0.0001) (Figure 3D). This indicates that natural dormant-origin backup firing capacity is limiting under extensive fork pausing, at least in this chromosomal region, to maintain local stability.Figure 3Dormant origin deficiency under Sic1 loss renders ChrV-L stability sensitive to delayed local replication(A) Map of the ChrV-L region following the introduction of an RFB from the rDNA at the indicated locus.(B) 2D gel analysis of fork pausing efficiency at the RFB locus in ChrV-L-RFB of Sic1-wt or Sic1-depleted cells.

Histograms of bubble arc intensities as in (C) (n = 2, mean ± sd; ns not statistically significant).See also Figure S3 and Table S1.In contrast, fork pausing at ChrV-L-RFB under Sic1 depletion was accompanied by deficient backup firing of dormant origins in comparison to Sic1 wt cells (bubble %, ARS505, 0.4 ± 0.5, t-test p value < 0.010143; ARS506, undetected) together with reduced ARS507 activity (bubble %, 30 ± 6, t-test p value < 0.033863) (Figure 3C). Under these conditions, the local GCR rate significantly raised by 350-fold (p value < 0.0001) (Figure 3D). Increasing backup firing activity at even a single dormant origin locus, sit1-ARS209(7X), to levels similar to Sic1 wt cells (bubble %, Sic1 depletion, 8.6 ± 1.2, t-test p value < 0.432507), was sufficient to significantly reduce the GCR rate by 4-fold (p value 0.0042) compared to the insertion of the control sit-empty region (p value 0.3260) (Figures 3D and 3E). This suggests that the limiting dormant-origin backup firing in response to significant fork stalling is further reduced under Sic1 depletion. These data show that the reduction of origin redundancy by Sic1 loss compromises ChrV-L stability under perturbed local replication.Sic1 depletion delays DNA synthesis completion in ChrV-LThe sensitivity of ChrV-L stability to delayed replication suggests that the mechanism of instability under Sic1 depletion could result from perturbation of local replication dynamics. To study whether deficient origin redundancy affects ChrV-L replication timing, we induced synchronous S-phase progression under Sic1 wt or Sic1 depletion conditions as shown in Figure 4A. In these conditions, Sic1 was depleted in GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells in telophase and in G1 phase (see Figure S4A). Cells progressed synchronously through G1 and S phases, and mitotic spindles started to appear by 100 min, indicating mitosis entry by this time (see Figure S4B). We monitored replication progression in cell samples collected from 20 to 100 min after telophase release, by detecting replication intermediates in 2D gels at distinct loci along ChrV-L. Figure 4B shows the replication dynamics in Sic1 wt cells. No replication intermediates were detected 20 min after the telophase release. By 40 min, replication bubbles and long forks appeared only at the ARS507 and ARS508 loci, indicating that ChrV-L replication initiated at these origins. By 55 min, passive forks reached the subtelomeric region at the ARS503-504 locus, consistent with the replication timing of this region.79 Bubble and fork signals started to decrease at ARS507 and ARS508 by 70 min and nearly disappeared by 85 min, revealing the end of active and passive replication of these loci. Simultaneously, fork signal increased at ARS506, ARS505 and ARS503-504, consistent with passive replication of the ChrV-L subtelomere. Although no bubble arcs were detected at ARS505 and ARS506 in normally exposed blots (Figure 4B), overexposing the blots and enlarging their size show weak B-arc signals at both origins (Figure 4C), indicating that they were active and late firing in a proportion of cells in these conditions. By 100 min, the signal of replication intermediates largely decreased at subtelomeric origins and disappeared at ARS507 and ARS508, indicating the time of bulk ChrV-L replication completion during S phase. This analysis revealed the wild-type replication dynamics of this region, from initiation to completion, under these conditions.Figure 4Sic1 depletion delays DNA synthesis completion in ChrV-L(A) Experimental outline for the induction of synchronous cell progression through S phase under Sic1-wt or Sic1-depletion conditions.(B) 2D gel analysis of firing activity at the indicated ARS in the ChrV-L region of Sic1-wt cells, at the indicated time-points (n = 1).

Similar to the Sic1 wt conditions, both the Sic1-sensitive ARS507 and the Sic1-resistant ARS508 origins fired by 40 min, indicating that Sic1 depletion did not affect origin firing timing (Figure 4D). Consistently, a population of forks reached the subtelomeric loci by 55 min, as observed in Sic1 wt cells, suggesting that fork progression was also unaffected by Sic1 depletion. By 70 min, bubbles started to decrease at ARS507 and ARS508 and disappeared afterwards, as in Sic1 wt cells (Figure 4D). Forks also disappeared at ARS508 with similar timing. However, small and long forks persisted at ARS507 even until 100 min, in contrast to Sic1 wt cells (Figure 4D), revealing passive replication of this origin in late S phase likely reflecting ARS507 deficiency. By 70 min, forks increased at ARS506, ARS505, and ARS503-504 as observed in Sic1 wt cells, but bubble intensities decreased at ARS505 and ARS506 (Figure 4E). These observations suggest ongoing passive ChrV-L replication under Sic1 loss at ARS507, and possibly the subtelomeric region, by the end of S phase.We aimed to quantitively measure ongoing DNA synthesis after bulk replication completion in Sic1 wt and Sic1 depleted cells. For this, we monitored incorporation of the thymidine-analogue BrdU on nascent DNA at foci distributed across ChrV-L (Figure 4F) through BrdU immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In a similar cdc15-2 block-and-release time-course as in Figure 4A (see Figures S4C and S4D), we added nocodazole after telophase release to block cell progression in the next G2/M, and split the cell cultures into two. For one-half, we added BrdU between 7 and 55 min after the telophase release to monitor DNA synthesis at the beginning of DNA replication. For the other half, we added BrdU from 145 to 205 min to monitor DNA replication by the time of mitosis, when bulk ChrV-L replication in Sic1 wt cells was completed according to 2D gels. During the 7–55 min interval (Figure 4G), abundant BrdU was detected in Sic1 wt cells near ARS507 and ARS508 (MAK10 and SPF1 loci, respectively), with ARS503 incorporating 3 to 5 times less BrdU, consistent with the replication dynamics observed in the 2D gels. In Sic1-depleted conditions, BrdU incorporation was similar to Sic1-wt at all loci. By the 145–205 min interval (Figure 4H), BrdU incorporation was largely reduced compared to the 7–55 min in both strains, consistent with the expected minor DNA synthesis occurring after bulk DNA synthesis than during early S phase. Consistently, Sic1 wt cells showed little BrdU incorporation at all ChrV-L loci analyzed, suggesting minor ongoing DNA synthesis in G2/M. In contrast, Sic1 depleted cells incorporated significantly higher BrdU incorporation at all loci across the region (t-test, ARS503 p value 0.00852, MAK10 p value 0.01381, SPF1 p value 0.01723). This shows that ChrV-L DNA synthesis continued by the time of mitosis under Sic1 loss, suggesting that Sic1 loss delays replication completion of the left arm of chromosome V. Altogether, these data show that deficient origin redundancy and increased instability correlate with ongoing DNA synthesis by the time of mitosis in this chromosome region when cells lack the CKI Sic1 protein.M-CDK reduction delays mitosis entry and suppresses ChrV-L instability under Sic1 depletionPremature S phase induced by overexpression of human cyclin E triggers under-replication, DNA synthesis in mitotic cells, abnormal anaphase segregation, and copy number losses at specific genomic regions,64 potentially leading to chromosome breakage and elevated rates of rearrangements. Similarly, Sic1 deletion induces deficient segregation of late-replicating subtelomeric regions.15 The ongoing DNA synthesis observed in G2/M under Sic1 loss suggests that unrestrained entry into mitosis may lead to aberrant segregation of under-replicated DNA, triggering chromosome rearrangements. To study whether this mechanism underlies ChrV-L rearrangements under Sic1 loss, we examined nuclear segregation in Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells. We measured the percentage of metaphase (single nucleus located in the mother cell body with short mitotic spindles) and anaphase cells (daughter nuclei being segregated between mother and daughter bodies with long mitotic spindles) in asynchronous cell cultures (Figure 5A). Sic1-depleted cells accumulated with partially segregated nuclear masses and elongated spindles, indicating deficient anaphase progression (Figure 5A). This is consistent with the partial sister chromatid separation observed in mutants lacking the Sic1 protein, which may resist the pulling forces of the elongating spindle, thereby delaying anaphase progression.15 To determine whether this anaphase delay and elevated ChrV-L GCR rate depend on unrestrained mitosis entry, we hypothesized that delaying mitosis entry could provide extra time for ongoing DNA synthesis, potentially reducing segregation delays and instability. To test this, we deleted the gene encoding cyclin Clb2 (clb2Δ) that along with cyclin Clb1 forms the M-CDK complexes.80 Clb2 is not essential, but clb2Δ delays mitosis entry by reducing M-CDK activity required for mitosis entry.80 Consistently, we observed that clb2Δ cells showed no loss of viability (Figure 5B) and accumulated in G2/M (Figures 5A and 5C). To assess the effect of clb2Δ on Sic1 depleted cells, we examined double mutants. The viability of Sic1-depleted clb2Δ double mutants was not compromised at 25°C (Figure 5B). We observed that the number of Sic1-depleted clb2Δ double-mutants in G1 phase remained as low as in Sic1-depleted cells (Figure 5C). Furthermore, ARS507 firing activity in Sic1-depleted clb2Δ cells was similar to Sic1 depleted CLB2 cells (Figure 1E), and significantly lower compared to Sic1-wt clb2Δ cells (bubble %, Sic1 wt, 56 ± 3.4; Sic1 depletion, 32 ± 7.1; t-test p value < 0.003270) (Figure 5D). The activity of ARS508 remained invariant in both strains (bubble %, Sic1 wt, 53 ± 7; Sic1 depletion, 51 ± 10; t-test p value < 0.431092) (Figure 5D). This shows that the reduction in M-CDK complexes due to clb2Δ does not suppress the G1-phase phenotype of Sic1 depletion. Despite this finding, Sic1-depleted clb2Δ double mutants suppressed the anaphase delay observed in Sic1 depleted cells (Figure 5A). Additionally, clb2Δ significantly reduced the ChrV-L GCR rate induced by Sic1 depletion (p value < 0.0001) (Figure 5E). These data shows that delaying mitosis entry due to clb2Δ can suppress ChrV-L instability resulting from origin deficiency under Sic1 depletion.Figure 5M-CDK reduction delays mitosis entry and suppresses ChrV-L instability under Sic1 depletion(A) Histogram showing the percentage of cells (n = 100) from the indicated strains exhibiting the phenotypes shown in the cell images bellow the plot: short spindle with an unsegregated nucleus located in mother cell body (left), and long spindle with partially segregated nuclear masses (right).

In the left arm of chromosome III (ChrIII-L), the deletion of most active origins raises local GCR rates if dormant origins are also lost.33 We therefore studied how origin activity resulting from Sic1 depletion affects local replication and stability at this region. Similar to ChrV-L, ChrIII-L displays several origins toward the chromosome end, and two active efficient origins in the internal zone, ARS305 and ARS306 (Figure 6A). Since ARS305 is found to be resistant to Sic1 depletion, while ARS306 is sensitive,15,66 ChrIII-L mimics the situation of ChrV-L with one sensitive and one resistant out of two active origins. But in contrast to ChrV-L, the resistant ARS305 origin is positioned in ChrIII-L closer to the telomere than the sensitive ARS306 origin. To analyze the activity of ChrIII-L origins in Sic1 wt and Sic1 depletion conditions we re-probed 2D gel blots from Figure 1F (Figure 6B). We confirmed the resistance of ARS305 (bubble %, Sic1 wt: 67 ± 4.2; Sic1 depletion: 69 ± 4.0; t-test p value < 0.271568) and the sensitivity of ARS306 to Sic1 loss (bubble %, Sic1 wt: 70 ± 1.9; Sic1 depletion: 50 ± 8.7; t-test p value < 0.042684). Bubble arcs were undetected in ARS300, ARS301, and ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 2D gels in these conditions (Figures 6B and 6C). Overall, there was a 25% reduction of active origin firing in ChrIII-L under Sic1 depletion, similar to ChrV-L. To analyze how this origin deficiency correlated with instability we inserted in ChrIII-L the GCR assay markers used in ChrV-L (Figure 6A). Strikingly, Sic1 depleted cells showed a ChrIII-L GCR rate 4-fold higher that Sic1 wt cells (p value 0.0086) (Figure 6D), which is around 6 times less than in ChrV-L. These data show that ChrIII-L was more stable than ChrV-L under Sic1 loss, despite similar active origin deficiency.Figure 6Origin deficiency and gross rearrangement rates at ChrIII-L under Sic1 loss(A) Map of the first 100 kilobases of ChrIII-L region showing, to scale, the major known or likely ARS, the genes relevant for the GCR assay (URA3 and CAN1 markers, and the first essential gene from TEL03L, KRR1; see (D), and the position of the amplicons used in the qPCR analysis (see Figure 7G).(B) Representative 2D gels showing firing activity of the indicated ARS in asynchronous Sic1-wt or Sic1-depleted cells (n = 3).

Numbers above bars indicate variation relative to Sic1-wt (GCR arbitrarily assigned to 1). Asterisks indicate statistical significance, as in Figure 1D (see p values in the main text).See also Table S1.The inactivity of ChrIII-L subtelomeric origins suggests no effect on local replication or stability, but limited origin activity can be undetected in 2D gels from asynchronous cells in contrast to synchronous cells, as shown for ChrV-L (see Figures 1F and 4C). To check this, and also to see how origin deficiency and instability correlate with replication progression along ChrIII-L, we re-probed the 2D blots used to analyze ChrV-L replication dynamics with probes of ChrIII-L origins (Figures 7A and 7B). We observed that ARS306 firing and replication timing were not affected by Sic1 depletion, as indicated by the presence of visible bubble and Y arcs in 2D gels at 40 min. ARS305 replication timing was also unaffected by Sic1 depletion, as replication forks at this locus were detectable in 2D gels by this time (note that the off-center position of the ARS305 locus within the 5.1 kb ClaI-ClaI DNA restriction fragment analyzed in these 2D gels −4.9 kb from 5′ and 0.1 kb from 3′- results in small bubble molecules, which do not generate a resolved bubble arc). This indicates that Sic1 depletion did not affect ChrIII-L replication timing in early or mid S phase, as in ChrV-L. Bubble arcs at ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 origins were now detected in synchronous cells from 55 to 100 min time-points, and at lower levels at ARS300 by 85 min, in both strains (Figures 7A–7C). Importantly, Sic1 depleted cells showed no activity reduction at these origins in comparison to Sic1 wt cells along the time-course (Figures 7C and 7D), showing that ARS300 and ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 are Sic1-depletion resistant origins. In addition, we did not detect backup firing at these origins (i.e., increased B-arc intensity regarding Sic1 wt conditions) under ARS306-deficient activity in Sic1 depleted cells, as would have been expected for redundant origins. This is consistent with dormant ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 backup activity only occurs under strong active origin failure, like ars305Δ or ars305Δ/ars306Δ,25 suggesting that ARS306 deficiency under Sic1 loss was insufficient to trigger ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 backup firing. The descending part of ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 Y-arc showed a fork pausing spot along the time-course (Figures 7A–7C). It corresponds to fork pausing at pre-replicative complexes present in these origins,81 indicating that spot intensity can be an estimate of origin licensing level. Figure 7E shows that the intensity of pausing spots maintained similar overall levels in both strains along the time-course. This suggests that ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 licensing was unaffected by Sic1 depletion. These data indicate that ChrIII-L concentrates a number of neighboring active and late/dormant (ARS305, ARS300, ARS302-ARS303-ARS320) origins unaffected by Sic1 depletion, which correlate with the low GCR rate of this region. This suggests that deficient late/dormant backup origins, and thus deficient origin redundancy, rather than overall origin activity reduction is the relevant factor contributing to increase the instability of specific genomic regions.Figure 7Minor origin deficiency and ongoing DNA synthesis at ChrIII-L under Sic1 loss(A) 2D gels showing the firing activity of the indicated ARS in the ChrIII-L region of Sic1-wt cells (n = 1).

To analyze this, we quantified BrdU incorporation after bulk ChrIII-L replication completion by qPCR of amplicons distributed along the region (Figure 6A). As for ChrV-L, DNA synthesis initiated by the 7–55 min window at ARS305 and ARS306 (FUS1) (Figure 7F). No significant reduction of BrdU incorporation was detected along the region in Sic1 depleted cells in this time period. By the 145–205 min interval, we detected significantly higher incorporation at the FUS1 locus under Sic1 depletion (t-test p value 0.00687), consistent with deficient ARS306 activity (Figure 7G). Importantly, no significant BrdU incorporation occurred at CHA1 (t-test p value 0.21787) and ARS305 (p value 0.09513), which flank the GCR rate markers, suggesting that the region where instability is measured is not delayed in DNA synthesis completion. Overall, these data show that limited instability in ChrIII-L correlates with proficient activity of neighboring active and late/dormant origins, deficient firing of a single active origin, and minor delay in local DNA synthesis completion. Overall, these data argue for a major role for unequal deficiency among origins under premature S phase accounting for unequal instability rates and replication completion delays between different genomic regions.

Sic1 depletion decreases origin redundancy in left chromosome V arm to induce most local gross chromosomal rearrangementsTo examine whether differential origin reduction is linked to uneven instability between genomic regions under Sic1 loss, we first studied how the activity of likely or confirmed origins67 affects the rate of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) (measured as the probability of simultaneous loss of URA3 and CAN1 genes per cell generation) in the left arm of budding yeast chromosome V (ChrV-L)68 (Figure 1A). In this region, reduced redundancy between the early-replicating origin of DNA replication ARS507 and the late/dormant origin ARS504.2 correlates with an elevated ChrV-L GCR rate in cells lacking the Sic1 protein, suggesting a direct link between these defects.15,66,68,69 In further support, increased origin density in ChrV-L reverses local GCR rates under deregulation of yeast G1-cyclin expression.53 To analyze this link, we repressed Sic1 protein expression by placing the endogenous SIC1 gene under the GAL1,10 promoter and switching GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells from galactose-to glucose-based rich media for 4 h. This reduced Sic1 protein levels by 95% compared to cells with wild-type Sic1 expression (Sic1 wt) (Figure 1B), decreased G1-phase cell number (Figure 1C), and increased ChrV-L GCR rates by 23-fold (Figure 1D, see Table S1). To analyze the activity of individual origins, we used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (2D gels), which separates replication bubbles (B) from single forks (Y) in chromosomal DNA fragments containing an origin (Figure 1E).70 The relative signal of B- and Y-arcs reflects qualitative variations in origin efficiency (Figure 1E). By this analysis, we reproduced that Sic1-depletion reduced ARS507 activity, while ARS508 remained unaffected66 (Figure 1F, see Figure S1). Semiquantitative analysis of arc signals can estimate origin efficiency as the percentage of bubbles in total replication intermediates.29,71 Biological triplicates of 2D gels of DNA fragments from asynchronous Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells were analyzed (Figure 1F, see Figure S1) (the analysis of ARS507 is shown as an example in Figure S2). Sic1 depletion halved ARS507 activity (bubble %, mean ± sd, Sic1 wt, 62 ± 4; Sic1 depletion, 34 ± 7; t-test p value < 0.001572), while ARS508 remained nearly unaffected (bubble %, Sic1 wt, 65 ± 1; Sic1 depletion, 62 ± 4; t-test p value < 0,145840), and the other origins remained inactive (undetected B arcs in these conditions). Consequently, depletion of Sic1 led to a 25% decrease in replication origin firing activity across all origins (50% of ARS507 and 95% of ARS508) within this chromosomal region.Figure 1Sic1 depletion decreases origin redundancy in left chromosome V arm to induce most local GCR rate(A) Map of the first 100 kilobases of ChrV-L showing to scale the major known or likely ARS loci, the SIT1 gene (see (J)), and the genes relevant for the GCR assay in this region (URA3 and CAN1 markers, and the first essential gene from TEL05L, PCM1) (see (D)).(B) Western blots showing Sic1 protein levels in asynchronous control cells (Sic1 wt) growing for 4 h in glucose-based YPAD media, or in asynchronous GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells after Sic1 depletion (4 h, YPAD) or induction (galactose media, YPARG) conditions (n = 3).

The precise substitution of ARS507 DNA by a DNA segment of identical length containing ARS305 (a Sic1 depletion-resistant origin) (ars507Δ-ARS305) nearly restores wild-type firing at this locus under Sic1 loss.66
Figure 1G shows that ars507Δ-ARS305 maintained a similar efficiency to ARS507 in Sic1 wt cells (bubble %, 68 ± 6; t-test p value < 0.096973), without significantly altering the ChrV-L GCR rate (p value 0.3815) (Figure 1D). In Sic1 depleted cells, ars507Δ-ARS305 restored 95% of wild-type ARS507 activity (bubble %, 59 ± 6; t-test p value < 0.06288) (Figure 1G), to significantly reduce the local GCR rate to one-third (p value 0.0002) (Figure 1D). This indicates that ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion is responsible for most ChrV-L rearrangements. We reasoned that if the ChrV-L GCR rate directly reflects the extent of ARS507 deficiency, increased ARS507 deficiency should exacerbate the GCR rate. Indeed, ARS507 deletion (ars507Δ) abolished firing in this locus in both Sic1 wt and Sic1 depletion conditions (Figure 1H). Importantly, the ChrV-L GCR rate in Sic1 depleted cells significantly increased up to 80-fold (p value 0.0158) (Figure 1D) in contrast to Sic1 wt cells (p value 0.7924). We conclude that Sic1 loss mainly destabilizes ChrV-L by affecting ARS507.ars507Δ mutation in Sic1 wt cells was accompanied by appearance of subtle, but reproducible, bubble arcs at ARS504.2 and proARS506 origins after overexposing 2D gels (bubble %, ARS504.2, 2.6 ± 0.2; proARS506, 3.2 ± 1.2) (note that blot overexposure to highlight signal of weak bubble arcs alters the view of the signal but not the underlying data for quantification (see STAR Methods)) (Figure 1H). This showed backup firing at these thereby dormant origins. This confirms the likely proARS506 as an active origin, and thus we renamed it as ARS506 and confirmed activity of ARS504.2 (here, renamed as ARS505 for consistency). In contrast, Sic1-depleted ars507Δ cells showed significant backup firing deficiency at the dormant ARS505 and ARS506 origins (bubble %, ARS505, 1 ± 0.4, p < 0.014369; ARS506, 1.6 ± 0.7, p value < 0.045692) (Figure 1H). This revealed these dormant origins are deficient under Sic1 depletion. This deficiency may explain the lack of backup response from these origins to ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion (Figure 1F), suggesting that deficient origin backup could contribute to ChrV-L GCRs. This is consistent with the concurrent loss of flanking active and dormant origins being necessary to induce instability of the left arm of chromosome III in wild-type yeast cells.33 To assess the contribution of dormant origin deficiency to ChrV-L GCR rate under Sic1 depletion, we removed or added dormant origins. To remove dormant origins, we deleted ARS505. Since no firing was detected at ARS505 (Figure 1F), ars505Δ produced no effect in 2D gels (Figure 1I). Sic1 wt ars505Δ cells showed no statistical GCR rate variation (p value 0.7), but Sic1-depleted ars505Δ cells exhibited a significant GCR rate increase up to 75-fold (p value 0.0081) (Figure 1D). This suggests that certain backup firing activity, undetected in ARS505 2D gels, could be lost in ars505Δ, contributing to local instability under Sic1 depletion. This also suggests that loss of dormant origins at ChrV-L is sufficient to aggravate instability in the context of Sic1-depletion deficient ARS507. To test this, we added extra origins to the region by inserting either an empty plasmid (sit1-empty) or the same plasmid containing a cluster of seven ARS209 Sic1 depletion-resistant origins (sit1-ARS209(7X)) at the SIT1 locus (Figure 1A). Sic1 wt cells showed no firing activity at sit1-empty and only a very weak signal at sit1-ARS209(7X) (see histograms in Figure 1J), consistent with statistically invariant ChrV-L GCR rates (sit1-empty p value 0.7555; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value 0.9126) (Figure 1D). In contrast, ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion triggered backup firing at sit1-ARS209(7X) (bubble %, 4.0 ± 0.2, t-test p value p < 0.016430) (Figure 1H), resulting in a significant reduction of the ChrV-L GCR rate to one-third (sit1-empty p value 0.5214; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value 0.0037) (Figure 1D). This shows that deficient backup firing from dormant origins in response to ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion induced ChrV-L instability.These data show that restoring either active or dormant origin efficiency under Sic1 loss similarly reduced most, but not all, GCR ChrV-L rates. However, combining ars507Δ-ARS305 and sit1-ARS209(7X) in Sic1-depleted cells did not further reduce GCR rates beyond the effect of each construct by separate (Figure 1D). Thereby, restoring the firing of either origin type was sufficient to suppress most instability under Sic1 loss, indicating redundancy between these origins. Nonetheless, one-third of the instability induced by Sic1 depletion in ChrV-L persisted, suggesting that other deficiencies caused by Sic1 loss may also contribute to instability. These could include reduced activity of additional origins on chromosome V, like ARS506, or origin-unrelated defects. Taken together, these data show that Sic1 depletion reduces the activity of both active and dormant neighboring origins, compromising local origin redundancy, and inducing most instability in the left arm of chromosome V.

Sic1 depletion decreases origin redundancy in left chromosome V arm to induce most local gross chromosomal rearrangements

To examine whether differential origin reduction is linked to uneven instability between genomic regions under Sic1 loss, we first studied how the activity of likely or confirmed origins67 affects the rate of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) (measured as the probability of simultaneous loss of URA3 and CAN1 genes per cell generation) in the left arm of budding yeast chromosome V (ChrV-L)68 (Figure 1A). In this region, reduced redundancy between the early-replicating origin of DNA replication ARS507 and the late/dormant origin ARS504.2 correlates with an elevated ChrV-L GCR rate in cells lacking the Sic1 protein, suggesting a direct link between these defects.15,66,68,69 In further support, increased origin density in ChrV-L reverses local GCR rates under deregulation of yeast G1-cyclin expression.53 To analyze this link, we repressed Sic1 protein expression by placing the endogenous SIC1 gene under the GAL1,10 promoter and switching GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells from galactose-to glucose-based rich media for 4 h. This reduced Sic1 protein levels by 95% compared to cells with wild-type Sic1 expression (Sic1 wt) (Figure 1B), decreased G1-phase cell number (Figure 1C), and increased ChrV-L GCR rates by 23-fold (Figure 1D, see Table S1). To analyze the activity of individual origins, we used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (2D gels), which separates replication bubbles (B) from single forks (Y) in chromosomal DNA fragments containing an origin (Figure 1E).70 The relative signal of B- and Y-arcs reflects qualitative variations in origin efficiency (Figure 1E). By this analysis, we reproduced that Sic1-depletion reduced ARS507 activity, while ARS508 remained unaffected66 (Figure 1F, see Figure S1). Semiquantitative analysis of arc signals can estimate origin efficiency as the percentage of bubbles in total replication intermediates.29,71 Biological triplicates of 2D gels of DNA fragments from asynchronous Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells were analyzed (Figure 1F, see Figure S1) (the analysis of ARS507 is shown as an example in Figure S2). Sic1 depletion halved ARS507 activity (bubble %, mean ± sd, Sic1 wt, 62 ± 4; Sic1 depletion, 34 ± 7; t-test p value < 0.001572), while ARS508 remained nearly unaffected (bubble %, Sic1 wt, 65 ± 1; Sic1 depletion, 62 ± 4; t-test p value < 0,145840), and the other origins remained inactive (undetected B arcs in these conditions). Consequently, depletion of Sic1 led to a 25% decrease in replication origin firing activity across all origins (50% of ARS507 and 95% of ARS508) within this chromosomal region.Figure 1Sic1 depletion decreases origin redundancy in left chromosome V arm to induce most local GCR rate(A) Map of the first 100 kilobases of ChrV-L showing to scale the major known or likely ARS loci, the SIT1 gene (see (J)), and the genes relevant for the GCR assay in this region (URA3 and CAN1 markers, and the first essential gene from TEL05L, PCM1) (see (D)).(B) Western blots showing Sic1 protein levels in asynchronous control cells (Sic1 wt) growing for 4 h in glucose-based YPAD media, or in asynchronous GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells after Sic1 depletion (4 h, YPAD) or induction (galactose media, YPARG) conditions (n = 3).

To determine the extent to which origin firing deficiency contributed to local instability in Sic1 depleted cells, we analyzed the rate of ChrV-L GCR after restoring ARS507 firing efficiency. The precise substitution of ARS507 DNA by a DNA segment of identical length containing ARS305 (a Sic1 depletion-resistant origin) (ars507Δ-ARS305) nearly restores wild-type firing at this locus under Sic1 loss.66
Figure 1G shows that ars507Δ-ARS305 maintained a similar efficiency to ARS507 in Sic1 wt cells (bubble %, 68 ± 6; t-test p value < 0.096973), without significantly altering the ChrV-L GCR rate (p value 0.3815) (Figure 1D). In Sic1 depleted cells, ars507Δ-ARS305 restored 95% of wild-type ARS507 activity (bubble %, 59 ± 6; t-test p value < 0.06288) (Figure 1G), to significantly reduce the local GCR rate to one-third (p value 0.0002) (Figure 1D). This indicates that ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion is responsible for most ChrV-L rearrangements. We reasoned that if the ChrV-L GCR rate directly reflects the extent of ARS507 deficiency, increased ARS507 deficiency should exacerbate the GCR rate. Indeed, ARS507 deletion (ars507Δ) abolished firing in this locus in both Sic1 wt and Sic1 depletion conditions (Figure 1H). Importantly, the ChrV-L GCR rate in Sic1 depleted cells significantly increased up to 80-fold (p value 0.0158) (Figure 1D) in contrast to Sic1 wt cells (p value 0.7924). We conclude that Sic1 loss mainly destabilizes ChrV-L by affecting ARS507.

ars507Δ mutation in Sic1 wt cells was accompanied by appearance of subtle, but reproducible, bubble arcs at ARS504.2 and proARS506 origins after overexposing 2D gels (bubble %, ARS504.2, 2.6 ± 0.2; proARS506, 3.2 ± 1.2) (note that blot overexposure to highlight signal of weak bubble arcs alters the view of the signal but not the underlying data for quantification (see STAR Methods)) (Figure 1H). This showed backup firing at these thereby dormant origins. This confirms the likely proARS506 as an active origin, and thus we renamed it as ARS506 and confirmed activity of ARS504.2 (here, renamed as ARS505 for consistency). In contrast, Sic1-depleted ars507Δ cells showed significant backup firing deficiency at the dormant ARS505 and ARS506 origins (bubble %, ARS505, 1 ± 0.4, p < 0.014369; ARS506, 1.6 ± 0.7, p value < 0.045692) (Figure 1H). This revealed these dormant origins are deficient under Sic1 depletion. This deficiency may explain the lack of backup response from these origins to ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion (Figure 1F), suggesting that deficient origin backup could contribute to ChrV-L GCRs. This is consistent with the concurrent loss of flanking active and dormant origins being necessary to induce instability of the left arm of chromosome III in wild-type yeast cells.33 To assess the contribution of dormant origin deficiency to ChrV-L GCR rate under Sic1 depletion, we removed or added dormant origins. To remove dormant origins, we deleted ARS505. Since no firing was detected at ARS505 (Figure 1F), ars505Δ produced no effect in 2D gels (Figure 1I). Sic1 wt ars505Δ cells showed no statistical GCR rate variation (p value 0.7), but Sic1-depleted ars505Δ cells exhibited a significant GCR rate increase up to 75-fold (p value 0.0081) (Figure 1D). This suggests that certain backup firing activity, undetected in ARS505 2D gels, could be lost in ars505Δ, contributing to local instability under Sic1 depletion. This also suggests that loss of dormant origins at ChrV-L is sufficient to aggravate instability in the context of Sic1-depletion deficient ARS507. To test this, we added extra origins to the region by inserting either an empty plasmid (sit1-empty) or the same plasmid containing a cluster of seven ARS209 Sic1 depletion-resistant origins (sit1-ARS209(7X)) at the SIT1 locus (Figure 1A). Sic1 wt cells showed no firing activity at sit1-empty and only a very weak signal at sit1-ARS209(7X) (see histograms in Figure 1J), consistent with statistically invariant ChrV-L GCR rates (sit1-empty p value 0.7555; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value 0.9126) (Figure 1D). In contrast, ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion triggered backup firing at sit1-ARS209(7X) (bubble %, 4.0 ± 0.2, t-test p value p < 0.016430) (Figure 1H), resulting in a significant reduction of the ChrV-L GCR rate to one-third (sit1-empty p value 0.5214; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value 0.0037) (Figure 1D). This shows that deficient backup firing from dormant origins in response to ARS507 deficiency under Sic1 depletion induced ChrV-L instability.

These data show that restoring either active or dormant origin efficiency under Sic1 loss similarly reduced most, but not all, GCR ChrV-L rates. However, combining ars507Δ-ARS305 and sit1-ARS209(7X) in Sic1-depleted cells did not further reduce GCR rates beyond the effect of each construct by separate (Figure 1D). Thereby, restoring the firing of either origin type was sufficient to suppress most instability under Sic1 loss, indicating redundancy between these origins. Nonetheless, one-third of the instability induced by Sic1 depletion in ChrV-L persisted, suggesting that other deficiencies caused by Sic1 loss may also contribute to instability. These could include reduced activity of additional origins on chromosome V, like ARS506, or origin-unrelated defects. Taken together, these data show that Sic1 depletion reduces the activity of both active and dormant neighboring origins, compromising local origin redundancy, and inducing most instability in the left arm of chromosome V.

Deficient origin activity under Sic1 loss does not induce S-phase checkpoint activation or sensitivity to exogenous replication stressThis significant contribution of origin deficiency to genomic instability prompted us to further investigate the underlying mechanism. Upregulation of CDK activity by oncogene activation leads to DNA replication stress and activation of the replication and DNA damage checkpoints in the path to genome instability during tumorigenesis.59,72 Replication stress poses a threat to genomic stability in normal and cancer cells.35,57 We wondered whether deficient origin redundancy by Sic1 depletion could similarly induce replication stress to levels activating the replication checkpoint response. In budding yeast, replication stress is detected as DNA gaps containing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which are recognized by the ssDNA-binding heterotrimeric Replication Protein A (RPA, composed of Rfa1, Rfa2, and Rfa3 subunits).73 The ssDNA-RPA complex recruits the ATRIP homolog Ddc2, which subsequently attracts and helps to activate the checkpoint sensor kinase Mec1. This leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the effector Rad53 kinase, initiating the checkpoint response.74 This leads to downstream events including stabilization of stalled forks and inhibition of new origin firing events.75,76 To assess checkpoint activation as a proxy of endogenous replication stress in Sic1 depleted cells, we quantified the levels of DNA-bound Rfa1 associated with sites of DNA synthesis during early S phase. To synchronize cells in early S-phase under Sic1 wt or Sic1 depletion conditions, we treated Sic1 wt and GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells containing Rfa1-9xPK-tagged protein and 7 copies of the thymidine kinase TK+ (7xTK+), enabling BrdU incorporation into nascent DNA,77 as shown in Figure 2A. In summary, repression of GAL1,10p-SIC1 in cells arrested in G2/M, followed by a telophase block-and-release using the cdc15-2 thermosensitive mutation, triggered synchronous cell progression through G1 and S phases (Figure 2Ai), and Sic1 depletion during telophase and G1 phase in GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells (Figure 2Aii). At 40 min post-release, we performed BrdU-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by real-time qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) to identify chromosomal DNA synthesis at this time-point. Figure 2Aiii shows BrdU incorporation at the early-replicating origins ARS305, ARS306, ARS507, and ARS508, while the late replicating subtelomeric origin ARS300 showed low BrdU incorporation. We detected no significant variation of BrdU abundance at these loci between Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells under these conditions. We then quantified the relative Rfa1-9xPK enrichment at these early-replicating origins after Rfa1-9xPK ChIP-qPCR (Figure 2Aiv). Importantly, we observed no variation in Rfa1 levels between Sic1-depleted and Sic1 wt cells, suggesting that Sic1 depletion do not increase RPA at replication forks during S phase. We also monitored Rad53 phosphorylation and Rad53 kinase activity. Immunoblot analysis of Rad53 did not evidence phosphorylated Rad53 under Sic1 depletion, and in situ kinase assay did not reveal Rad53 autophosphorylation (Figure 2B), indicating absence of S phase checkpoint activation in these conditions. This cannot be attributed to checkpoint activation deficiency under Sic1 depletion, as exogenous replication stress induced by hydroxyurea (HU), the inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, activated Rad53 kinase to similar levels in Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells (Figure 2A). Consistent with this lack of checkpoint activation, Sic1-depleted cells did not require Mec1 or Rad53 for viability (Figure 2C). These data strongly suggest that Sic1 depletion does not trigger endogenous replication stress to levels activating the checkpoint, ruling out a putative implication in genomic instability. The lack of checkpoint activation also discards that origin deficiency in Sic1 lacking cells is due to checkpoint-dependent inhibition of origin firing.Figure 2Deficient origin activity under Sic1 loss does not induce S-phase checkpoint activation or sensitivity to exogenous replication stress(A) cdc15-2 block-and-release experiment for synchronous progression of Sic1 wt and GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells of the indicated genotype through G1 and S phases.

Figure 2D shows that cell viability was not perturbed by Sic1 loss in these conditions. These data show that reduction of origin activity due to Sic1 depletion does not sensitize cells to exogenous replication stress.

Deficient origin activity under Sic1 loss does not induce S-phase checkpoint activation or sensitivity to exogenous replication stress

This significant contribution of origin deficiency to genomic instability prompted us to further investigate the underlying mechanism. Upregulation of CDK activity by oncogene activation leads to DNA replication stress and activation of the replication and DNA damage checkpoints in the path to genome instability during tumorigenesis.59,72 Replication stress poses a threat to genomic stability in normal and cancer cells.35,57 We wondered whether deficient origin redundancy by Sic1 depletion could similarly induce replication stress to levels activating the replication checkpoint response. In budding yeast, replication stress is detected as DNA gaps containing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which are recognized by the ssDNA-binding heterotrimeric Replication Protein A (RPA, composed of Rfa1, Rfa2, and Rfa3 subunits).73 The ssDNA-RPA complex recruits the ATRIP homolog Ddc2, which subsequently attracts and helps to activate the checkpoint sensor kinase Mec1. This leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the effector Rad53 kinase, initiating the checkpoint response.74 This leads to downstream events including stabilization of stalled forks and inhibition of new origin firing events.75,76 To assess checkpoint activation as a proxy of endogenous replication stress in Sic1 depleted cells, we quantified the levels of DNA-bound Rfa1 associated with sites of DNA synthesis during early S phase. To synchronize cells in early S-phase under Sic1 wt or Sic1 depletion conditions, we treated Sic1 wt and GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells containing Rfa1-9xPK-tagged protein and 7 copies of the thymidine kinase TK+ (7xTK+), enabling BrdU incorporation into nascent DNA,77 as shown in Figure 2A. In summary, repression of GAL1,10p-SIC1 in cells arrested in G2/M, followed by a telophase block-and-release using the cdc15-2 thermosensitive mutation, triggered synchronous cell progression through G1 and S phases (Figure 2Ai), and Sic1 depletion during telophase and G1 phase in GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells (Figure 2Aii). At 40 min post-release, we performed BrdU-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by real-time qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) to identify chromosomal DNA synthesis at this time-point. Figure 2Aiii shows BrdU incorporation at the early-replicating origins ARS305, ARS306, ARS507, and ARS508, while the late replicating subtelomeric origin ARS300 showed low BrdU incorporation. We detected no significant variation of BrdU abundance at these loci between Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells under these conditions. We then quantified the relative Rfa1-9xPK enrichment at these early-replicating origins after Rfa1-9xPK ChIP-qPCR (Figure 2Aiv). Importantly, we observed no variation in Rfa1 levels between Sic1-depleted and Sic1 wt cells, suggesting that Sic1 depletion do not increase RPA at replication forks during S phase. We also monitored Rad53 phosphorylation and Rad53 kinase activity. Immunoblot analysis of Rad53 did not evidence phosphorylated Rad53 under Sic1 depletion, and in situ kinase assay did not reveal Rad53 autophosphorylation (Figure 2B), indicating absence of S phase checkpoint activation in these conditions. This cannot be attributed to checkpoint activation deficiency under Sic1 depletion, as exogenous replication stress induced by hydroxyurea (HU), the inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, activated Rad53 kinase to similar levels in Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells (Figure 2A). Consistent with this lack of checkpoint activation, Sic1-depleted cells did not require Mec1 or Rad53 for viability (Figure 2C). These data strongly suggest that Sic1 depletion does not trigger endogenous replication stress to levels activating the checkpoint, ruling out a putative implication in genomic instability. The lack of checkpoint activation also discards that origin deficiency in Sic1 lacking cells is due to checkpoint-dependent inhibition of origin firing.Figure 2Deficient origin activity under Sic1 loss does not induce S-phase checkpoint activation or sensitivity to exogenous replication stress(A) cdc15-2 block-and-release experiment for synchronous progression of Sic1 wt and GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells of the indicated genotype through G1 and S phases.

To see whether decreased origin redundancy under Sic1 depletion compromises cell viability under exogenous replication stress, we exposed Sic1 wt and Sic1-lacking cells to HU, which stalls replication forks by depleting dNTP pools. Figure 2D shows that cell viability was not perturbed by Sic1 loss in these conditions. These data show that reduction of origin activity due to Sic1 depletion does not sensitize cells to exogenous replication stress.

Dormant origin deficiency under Sic1 loss renders ChrV-L stability sensitive to delayed local replicationUnaffected cell viability under Sic1 depletion, even in presence of exogenous replication stress, could reflect the partial firing deficiency at a subset of origins due to Sic1 loss.66 As a result, specific genomic regions rather than the genome globally, can be affected. To test whether deficient origin redundancy in ChrV-L compromises the response to local replication stress, we aimed to induce replication stress in this region. Fork pausing at natural protein-DNA fork barriers present in the genome is a source of localized replication stress that delay replication by halting replisome progression.35 In budding yeast, each rDNA repeat contains such replication fork barriers (RFB), which pause forks in a polar manner that is detected by 2D gels78 (see Figure S3A). This RFB can be inserted into a specific genomic locus outside the rDNA in the form of a “RFB cassette” (see Figure S3A) to transiently pause replication outside the rDNA without triggering a cellular checkpoint response.27 We confirmed that fork pausing at protein-DNA fork barriers is independent of Sic1 protein, as forks efficiently paused under Sic1 depletion at the rDNA RFB (t-test p value < 0.474263) or at pre-replication complexes at licensed origins like the Sic1 depletion-resistant ARS522 origin (t-test p value < 0.097221) (see Figure S3B). We used that RFB cassette as a tool to induce directional slow-down of DNA replication in ChrV-L, by inserting it in ChrV-L positioned to halt forks progressing toward the telomere, the main replication direction in this region79 (Figure 3A; see Figure S3C). 2D gels show that forks efficiently paused at the ChrV-L-RFB locus to similar levels in Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted asynchronous cells (p value < 0.397991) (Figure 3B), without affecting cell viability (see Figure S3D). In Sic1 wt cells, this triggered backup firing of the downstream dormant ARS505 and ARS506 origins (bubble %, ARS505, 1.5 ± 0.6; ARS506, 1.4 ± 0.2) (Figure 3C). Despite this, the local GCR rate increased significantly (p value < 0.0001) by 19-fold (Figure 3D), showing that strong fork pausing induces genomic instability in wt cells. The insertion of extra dormant origins at the SIT1 locus, sit1-ARS209(7X), but not the insertion of the control sit1-empty sequence, produced backup firing (bubble %, 8.2 ± 2.4) (Figure 3E), and significantly reduced the local GCR rate by 3-fold (sit1-empty p value 0.6172; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value < 0.0001) (Figure 3D). This indicates that natural dormant-origin backup firing capacity is limiting under extensive fork pausing, at least in this chromosomal region, to maintain local stability.Figure 3Dormant origin deficiency under Sic1 loss renders ChrV-L stability sensitive to delayed local replication(A) Map of the ChrV-L region following the introduction of an RFB from the rDNA at the indicated locus.(B) 2D gel analysis of fork pausing efficiency at the RFB locus in ChrV-L-RFB of Sic1-wt or Sic1-depleted cells.

Under these conditions, the local GCR rate significantly raised by 350-fold (p value < 0.0001) (Figure 3D). Increasing backup firing activity at even a single dormant origin locus, sit1-ARS209(7X), to levels similar to Sic1 wt cells (bubble %, Sic1 depletion, 8.6 ± 1.2, t-test p value < 0.432507), was sufficient to significantly reduce the GCR rate by 4-fold (p value 0.0042) compared to the insertion of the control sit-empty region (p value 0.3260) (Figures 3D and 3E). This suggests that the limiting dormant-origin backup firing in response to significant fork stalling is further reduced under Sic1 depletion. These data show that the reduction of origin redundancy by Sic1 loss compromises ChrV-L stability under perturbed local replication.

Dormant origin deficiency under Sic1 loss renders ChrV-L stability sensitive to delayed local replication

Unaffected cell viability under Sic1 depletion, even in presence of exogenous replication stress, could reflect the partial firing deficiency at a subset of origins due to Sic1 loss.66 As a result, specific genomic regions rather than the genome globally, can be affected. To test whether deficient origin redundancy in ChrV-L compromises the response to local replication stress, we aimed to induce replication stress in this region. Fork pausing at natural protein-DNA fork barriers present in the genome is a source of localized replication stress that delay replication by halting replisome progression.35 In budding yeast, each rDNA repeat contains such replication fork barriers (RFB), which pause forks in a polar manner that is detected by 2D gels78 (see Figure S3A).

In Sic1 wt cells, this triggered backup firing of the downstream dormant ARS505 and ARS506 origins (bubble %, ARS505, 1.5 ± 0.6; ARS506, 1.4 ± 0.2) (Figure 3C). Despite this, the local GCR rate increased significantly (p value < 0.0001) by 19-fold (Figure 3D), showing that strong fork pausing induces genomic instability in wt cells. The insertion of extra dormant origins at the SIT1 locus, sit1-ARS209(7X), but not the insertion of the control sit1-empty sequence, produced backup firing (bubble %, 8.2 ± 2.4) (Figure 3E), and significantly reduced the local GCR rate by 3-fold (sit1-empty p value 0.6172; sit1-ARS209(7X) p value < 0.0001) (Figure 3D).

In contrast, fork pausing at ChrV-L-RFB under Sic1 depletion was accompanied by deficient backup firing of dormant origins in comparison to Sic1 wt cells (bubble %, ARS505, 0.4 ± 0.5, t-test p value < 0.010143; ARS506, undetected) together with reduced ARS507 activity (bubble %, 30 ± 6, t-test p value < 0.033863) (Figure 3C). Under these conditions, the local GCR rate significantly raised by 350-fold (p value < 0.0001) (Figure 3D). Increasing backup firing activity at even a single dormant origin locus, sit1-ARS209(7X), to levels similar to Sic1 wt cells (bubble %, Sic1 depletion, 8.6 ± 1.2, t-test p value < 0.432507), was sufficient to significantly reduce the GCR rate by 4-fold (p value 0.0042) compared to the insertion of the control sit-empty region (p value 0.3260) (Figures 3D and 3E). This suggests that the limiting dormant-origin backup firing in response to significant fork stalling is further reduced under Sic1 depletion. These data show that the reduction of origin redundancy by Sic1 loss compromises ChrV-L stability under perturbed local replication.

Sic1 depletion delays DNA synthesis completion in ChrV-LThe sensitivity of ChrV-L stability to delayed replication suggests that the mechanism of instability under Sic1 depletion could result from perturbation of local replication dynamics. To study whether deficient origin redundancy affects ChrV-L replication timing, we induced synchronous S-phase progression under Sic1 wt or Sic1 depletion conditions as shown in Figure 4A. In these conditions, Sic1 was depleted in GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells in telophase and in G1 phase (see Figure S4A). Cells progressed synchronously through G1 and S phases, and mitotic spindles started to appear by 100 min, indicating mitosis entry by this time (see Figure S4B). We monitored replication progression in cell samples collected from 20 to 100 min after telophase release, by detecting replication intermediates in 2D gels at distinct loci along ChrV-L. Figure 4B shows the replication dynamics in Sic1 wt cells. No replication intermediates were detected 20 min after the telophase release. By 40 min, replication bubbles and long forks appeared only at the ARS507 and ARS508 loci, indicating that ChrV-L replication initiated at these origins. By 55 min, passive forks reached the subtelomeric region at the ARS503-504 locus, consistent with the replication timing of this region.79 Bubble and fork signals started to decrease at ARS507 and ARS508 by 70 min and nearly disappeared by 85 min, revealing the end of active and passive replication of these loci. Simultaneously, fork signal increased at ARS506, ARS505 and ARS503-504, consistent with passive replication of the ChrV-L subtelomere. Although no bubble arcs were detected at ARS505 and ARS506 in normally exposed blots (Figure 4B), overexposing the blots and enlarging their size show weak B-arc signals at both origins (Figure 4C), indicating that they were active and late firing in a proportion of cells in these conditions. By 100 min, the signal of replication intermediates largely decreased at subtelomeric origins and disappeared at ARS507 and ARS508, indicating the time of bulk ChrV-L replication completion during S phase. This analysis revealed the wild-type replication dynamics of this region, from initiation to completion, under these conditions.Figure 4Sic1 depletion delays DNA synthesis completion in ChrV-L(A) Experimental outline for the induction of synchronous cell progression through S phase under Sic1-wt or Sic1-depletion conditions.(B) 2D gel analysis of firing activity at the indicated ARS in the ChrV-L region of Sic1-wt cells, at the indicated time-points (n = 1).

Similar to the Sic1 wt conditions, both the Sic1-sensitive ARS507 and the Sic1-resistant ARS508 origins fired by 40 min, indicating that Sic1 depletion did not affect origin firing timing (Figure 4D). Consistently, a population of forks reached the subtelomeric loci by 55 min, as observed in Sic1 wt cells, suggesting that fork progression was also unaffected by Sic1 depletion. By 70 min, bubbles started to decrease at ARS507 and ARS508 and disappeared afterwards, as in Sic1 wt cells (Figure 4D). Forks also disappeared at ARS508 with similar timing. However, small and long forks persisted at ARS507 even until 100 min, in contrast to Sic1 wt cells (Figure 4D), revealing passive replication of this origin in late S phase likely reflecting ARS507 deficiency. By 70 min, forks increased at ARS506, ARS505, and ARS503-504 as observed in Sic1 wt cells, but bubble intensities decreased at ARS505 and ARS506 (Figure 4E). These observations suggest ongoing passive ChrV-L replication under Sic1 loss at ARS507, and possibly the subtelomeric region, by the end of S phase.We aimed to quantitively measure ongoing DNA synthesis after bulk replication completion in Sic1 wt and Sic1 depleted cells. For this, we monitored incorporation of the thymidine-analogue BrdU on nascent DNA at foci distributed across ChrV-L (Figure 4F) through BrdU immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In a similar cdc15-2 block-and-release time-course as in Figure 4A (see Figures S4C and S4D), we added nocodazole after telophase release to block cell progression in the next G2/M, and split the cell cultures into two. For one-half, we added BrdU between 7 and 55 min after the telophase release to monitor DNA synthesis at the beginning of DNA replication. For the other half, we added BrdU from 145 to 205 min to monitor DNA replication by the time of mitosis, when bulk ChrV-L replication in Sic1 wt cells was completed according to 2D gels. During the 7–55 min interval (Figure 4G), abundant BrdU was detected in Sic1 wt cells near ARS507 and ARS508 (MAK10 and SPF1 loci, respectively), with ARS503 incorporating 3 to 5 times less BrdU, consistent with the replication dynamics observed in the 2D gels. In Sic1-depleted conditions, BrdU incorporation was similar to Sic1-wt at all loci. By the 145–205 min interval (Figure 4H), BrdU incorporation was largely reduced compared to the 7–55 min in both strains, consistent with the expected minor DNA synthesis occurring after bulk DNA synthesis than during early S phase. Consistently, Sic1 wt cells showed little BrdU incorporation at all ChrV-L loci analyzed, suggesting minor ongoing DNA synthesis in G2/M. In contrast, Sic1 depleted cells incorporated significantly higher BrdU incorporation at all loci across the region (t-test, ARS503 p value 0.00852, MAK10 p value 0.01381, SPF1 p value 0.01723). This shows that ChrV-L DNA synthesis continued by the time of mitosis under Sic1 loss, suggesting that Sic1 loss delays replication completion of the left arm of chromosome V. Altogether, these data show that deficient origin redundancy and increased instability correlate with ongoing DNA synthesis by the time of mitosis in this chromosome region when cells lack the CKI Sic1 protein.

Sic1 depletion delays DNA synthesis completion in ChrV-L

The sensitivity of ChrV-L stability to delayed replication suggests that the mechanism of instability under Sic1 depletion could result from perturbation of local replication dynamics. To study whether deficient origin redundancy affects ChrV-L replication timing, we induced synchronous S-phase progression under Sic1 wt or Sic1 depletion conditions as shown in Figure 4A. In these conditions, Sic1 was depleted in GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells in telophase and in G1 phase (see Figure S4A). Cells progressed synchronously through G1 and S phases, and mitotic spindles started to appear by 100 min, indicating mitosis entry by this time (see Figure S4B). We monitored replication progression in cell samples collected from 20 to 100 min after telophase release, by detecting replication intermediates in 2D gels at distinct loci along ChrV-L. Figure 4B shows the replication dynamics in Sic1 wt cells. No replication intermediates were detected 20 min after the telophase release. By 40 min, replication bubbles and long forks appeared only at the ARS507 and ARS508 loci, indicating that ChrV-L replication initiated at these origins. By 55 min, passive forks reached the subtelomeric region at the ARS503-504 locus, consistent with the replication timing of this region.79 Bubble and fork signals started to decrease at ARS507 and ARS508 by 70 min and nearly disappeared by 85 min, revealing the end of active and passive replication of these loci. Simultaneously, fork signal increased at ARS506, ARS505 and ARS503-504, consistent with passive replication of the ChrV-L subtelomere. Although no bubble arcs were detected at ARS505 and ARS506 in normally exposed blots (Figure 4B), overexposing the blots and enlarging their size show weak B-arc signals at both origins (Figure 4C), indicating that they were active and late firing in a proportion of cells in these conditions. By 100 min, the signal of replication intermediates largely decreased at subtelomeric origins and disappeared at ARS507 and ARS508, indicating the time of bulk ChrV-L replication completion during S phase. This analysis revealed the wild-type replication dynamics of this region, from initiation to completion, under these conditions.Figure 4Sic1 depletion delays DNA synthesis completion in ChrV-L(A) Experimental outline for the induction of synchronous cell progression through S phase under Sic1-wt or Sic1-depletion conditions.(B) 2D gel analysis of firing activity at the indicated ARS in the ChrV-L region of Sic1-wt cells, at the indicated time-points (n = 1).

We performed the same replication dynamics in Sic1-depleted cells (Figure 4D). Similar to the Sic1 wt conditions, both the Sic1-sensitive ARS507 and the Sic1-resistant ARS508 origins fired by 40 min, indicating that Sic1 depletion did not affect origin firing timing (Figure 4D). Consistently, a population of forks reached the subtelomeric loci by 55 min, as observed in Sic1 wt cells, suggesting that fork progression was also unaffected by Sic1 depletion. By 70 min, bubbles started to decrease at ARS507 and ARS508 and disappeared afterwards, as in Sic1 wt cells (Figure 4D). Forks also disappeared at ARS508 with similar timing. However, small and long forks persisted at ARS507 even until 100 min, in contrast to Sic1 wt cells (Figure 4D), revealing passive replication of this origin in late S phase likely reflecting ARS507 deficiency. By 70 min, forks increased at ARS506, ARS505, and ARS503-504 as observed in Sic1 wt cells, but bubble intensities decreased at ARS505 and ARS506 (Figure 4E). These observations suggest ongoing passive ChrV-L replication under Sic1 loss at ARS507, and possibly the subtelomeric region, by the end of S phase.

We aimed to quantitively measure ongoing DNA synthesis after bulk replication completion in Sic1 wt and Sic1 depleted cells. For this, we monitored incorporation of the thymidine-analogue BrdU on nascent DNA at foci distributed across ChrV-L (Figure 4F) through BrdU immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In a similar cdc15-2 block-and-release time-course as in Figure 4A (see Figures S4C and S4D), we added nocodazole after telophase release to block cell progression in the next G2/M, and split the cell cultures into two. For one-half, we added BrdU between 7 and 55 min after the telophase release to monitor DNA synthesis at the beginning of DNA replication. For the other half, we added BrdU from 145 to 205 min to monitor DNA replication by the time of mitosis, when bulk ChrV-L replication in Sic1 wt cells was completed according to 2D gels. During the 7–55 min interval (Figure 4G), abundant BrdU was detected in Sic1 wt cells near ARS507 and ARS508 (MAK10 and SPF1 loci, respectively), with ARS503 incorporating 3 to 5 times less BrdU, consistent with the replication dynamics observed in the 2D gels. In Sic1-depleted conditions, BrdU incorporation was similar to Sic1-wt at all loci. By the 145–205 min interval (Figure 4H), BrdU incorporation was largely reduced compared to the 7–55 min in both strains, consistent with the expected minor DNA synthesis occurring after bulk DNA synthesis than during early S phase. Consistently, Sic1 wt cells showed little BrdU incorporation at all ChrV-L loci analyzed, suggesting minor ongoing DNA synthesis in G2/M. In contrast, Sic1 depleted cells incorporated significantly higher BrdU incorporation at all loci across the region (t-test, ARS503 p value 0.00852, MAK10 p value 0.01381, SPF1 p value 0.01723). This shows that ChrV-L DNA synthesis continued by the time of mitosis under Sic1 loss, suggesting that Sic1 loss delays replication completion of the left arm of chromosome V. Altogether, these data show that deficient origin redundancy and increased instability correlate with ongoing DNA synthesis by the time of mitosis in this chromosome region when cells lack the CKI Sic1 protein.

M-CDK reduction delays mitosis entry and suppresses ChrV-L instability under Sic1 depletionPremature S phase induced by overexpression of human cyclin E triggers under-replication, DNA synthesis in mitotic cells, abnormal anaphase segregation, and copy number losses at specific genomic regions,64 potentially leading to chromosome breakage and elevated rates of rearrangements. Similarly, Sic1 deletion induces deficient segregation of late-replicating subtelomeric regions.15 The ongoing DNA synthesis observed in G2/M under Sic1 loss suggests that unrestrained entry into mitosis may lead to aberrant segregation of under-replicated DNA, triggering chromosome rearrangements. To study whether this mechanism underlies ChrV-L rearrangements under Sic1 loss, we examined nuclear segregation in Sic1 wt and Sic1-depleted cells. We measured the percentage of metaphase (single nucleus located in the mother cell body with short mitotic spindles) and anaphase cells (daughter nuclei being segregated between mother and daughter bodies with long mitotic spindles) in asynchronous cell cultures (Figure 5A). Sic1-depleted cells accumulated with partially segregated nuclear masses and elongated spindles, indicating deficient anaphase progression (Figure 5A). This is consistent with the partial sister chromatid separation observed in mutants lacking the Sic1 protein, which may resist the pulling forces of the elongating spindle, thereby delaying anaphase progression.15 To determine whether this anaphase delay and elevated ChrV-L GCR rate depend on unrestrained mitosis entry, we hypothesized that delaying mitosis entry could provide extra time for ongoing DNA synthesis, potentially reducing segregation delays and instability. To test this, we deleted the gene encoding cyclin Clb2 (clb2Δ) that along with cyclin Clb1 forms the M-CDK complexes.80 Clb2 is not essential, but clb2Δ delays mitosis entry by reducing M-CDK activity required for mitosis entry.80 Consistently, we observed that clb2Δ cells showed no loss of viability (Figure 5B) and accumulated in G2/M (Figures 5A and 5C). To assess the effect of clb2Δ on Sic1 depleted cells, we examined double mutants. The viability of Sic1-depleted clb2Δ double mutants was not compromised at 25°C (Figure 5B). We observed that the number of Sic1-depleted clb2Δ double-mutants in G1 phase remained as low as in Sic1-depleted cells (Figure 5C). Furthermore, ARS507 firing activity in Sic1-depleted clb2Δ cells was similar to Sic1 depleted CLB2 cells (Figure 1E), and significantly lower compared to Sic1-wt clb2Δ cells (bubble %, Sic1 wt, 56 ± 3.4; Sic1 depletion, 32 ± 7.1; t-test p value < 0.003270) (Figure 5D). The activity of ARS508 remained invariant in both strains (bubble %, Sic1 wt, 53 ± 7; Sic1 depletion, 51 ± 10; t-test p value < 0.431092) (Figure 5D). This shows that the reduction in M-CDK complexes due to clb2Δ does not suppress the G1-phase phenotype of Sic1 depletion. Despite this finding, Sic1-depleted clb2Δ double mutants suppressed the anaphase delay observed in Sic1 depleted cells (Figure 5A). Additionally, clb2Δ significantly reduced the ChrV-L GCR rate induced by Sic1 depletion (p value < 0.0001) (Figure 5E). These data shows that delaying mitosis entry due to clb2Δ can suppress ChrV-L instability resulting from origin deficiency under Sic1 depletion.Figure 5M-CDK reduction delays mitosis entry and suppresses ChrV-L instability under Sic1 depletion(A) Histogram showing the percentage of cells (n = 100) from the indicated strains exhibiting the phenotypes shown in the cell images bellow the plot: short spindle with an unsegregated nucleus located in mother cell body (left), and long spindle with partially segregated nuclear masses (right).

Minor origin deficiency, ongoing DNA synthesis, and instability at ChrIII-L under Sic1 lossTo analyze whether differential origin deficiency unequally impacts replication completion and stability between genomic regions, we studied them in a second chromosome arm. In the left arm of chromosome III (ChrIII-L), the deletion of most active origins raises local GCR rates if dormant origins are also lost.33 We therefore studied how origin activity resulting from Sic1 depletion affects local replication and stability at this region. Similar to ChrV-L, ChrIII-L displays several origins toward the chromosome end, and two active efficient origins in the internal zone, ARS305 and ARS306 (Figure 6A). Since ARS305 is found to be resistant to Sic1 depletion, while ARS306 is sensitive,15,66 ChrIII-L mimics the situation of ChrV-L with one sensitive and one resistant out of two active origins. But in contrast to ChrV-L, the resistant ARS305 origin is positioned in ChrIII-L closer to the telomere than the sensitive ARS306 origin. To analyze the activity of ChrIII-L origins in Sic1 wt and Sic1 depletion conditions we re-probed 2D gel blots from Figure 1F (Figure 6B). We confirmed the resistance of ARS305 (bubble %, Sic1 wt: 67 ± 4.2; Sic1 depletion: 69 ± 4.0; t-test p value < 0.271568) and the sensitivity of ARS306 to Sic1 loss (bubble %, Sic1 wt: 70 ± 1.9; Sic1 depletion: 50 ± 8.7; t-test p value < 0.042684). Bubble arcs were undetected in ARS300, ARS301, and ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 2D gels in these conditions (Figures 6B and 6C). Overall, there was a 25% reduction of active origin firing in ChrIII-L under Sic1 depletion, similar to ChrV-L. To analyze how this origin deficiency correlated with instability we inserted in ChrIII-L the GCR assay markers used in ChrV-L (Figure 6A). Strikingly, Sic1 depleted cells showed a ChrIII-L GCR rate 4-fold higher that Sic1 wt cells (p value 0.0086) (Figure 6D), which is around 6 times less than in ChrV-L. These data show that ChrIII-L was more stable than ChrV-L under Sic1 loss, despite similar active origin deficiency.Figure 6Origin deficiency and gross rearrangement rates at ChrIII-L under Sic1 loss(A) Map of the first 100 kilobases of ChrIII-L region showing, to scale, the major known or likely ARS, the genes relevant for the GCR assay (URA3 and CAN1 markers, and the first essential gene from TEL03L, KRR1; see (D), and the position of the amplicons used in the qPCR analysis (see Figure 7G).(B) Representative 2D gels showing firing activity of the indicated ARS in asynchronous Sic1-wt or Sic1-depleted cells (n = 3).

Numbers above bars indicate variation relative to Sic1-wt (GCR arbitrarily assigned to 1). Asterisks indicate statistical significance, as in Figure 1D (see p values in the main text).See also Table S1.The inactivity of ChrIII-L subtelomeric origins suggests no effect on local replication or stability, but limited origin activity can be undetected in 2D gels from asynchronous cells in contrast to synchronous cells, as shown for ChrV-L (see Figures 1F and 4C). To check this, and also to see how origin deficiency and instability correlate with replication progression along ChrIII-L, we re-probed the 2D blots used to analyze ChrV-L replication dynamics with probes of ChrIII-L origins (Figures 7A and 7B). We observed that ARS306 firing and replication timing were not affected by Sic1 depletion, as indicated by the presence of visible bubble and Y arcs in 2D gels at 40 min. ARS305 replication timing was also unaffected by Sic1 depletion, as replication forks at this locus were detectable in 2D gels by this time (note that the off-center position of the ARS305 locus within the 5.1 kb ClaI-ClaI DNA restriction fragment analyzed in these 2D gels −4.9 kb from 5′ and 0.1 kb from 3′- results in small bubble molecules, which do not generate a resolved bubble arc). This indicates that Sic1 depletion did not affect ChrIII-L replication timing in early or mid S phase, as in ChrV-L. Bubble arcs at ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 origins were now detected in synchronous cells from 55 to 100 min time-points, and at lower levels at ARS300 by 85 min, in both strains (Figures 7A–7C). Importantly, Sic1 depleted cells showed no activity reduction at these origins in comparison to Sic1 wt cells along the time-course (Figures 7C and 7D), showing that ARS300 and ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 are Sic1-depletion resistant origins. In addition, we did not detect backup firing at these origins (i.e., increased B-arc intensity regarding Sic1 wt conditions) under ARS306-deficient activity in Sic1 depleted cells, as would have been expected for redundant origins. This is consistent with dormant ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 backup activity only occurs under strong active origin failure, like ars305Δ or ars305Δ/ars306Δ,25 suggesting that ARS306 deficiency under Sic1 loss was insufficient to trigger ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 backup firing. The descending part of ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 Y-arc showed a fork pausing spot along the time-course (Figures 7A–7C). It corresponds to fork pausing at pre-replicative complexes present in these origins,81 indicating that spot intensity can be an estimate of origin licensing level. Figure 7E shows that the intensity of pausing spots maintained similar overall levels in both strains along the time-course. This suggests that ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 licensing was unaffected by Sic1 depletion. These data indicate that ChrIII-L concentrates a number of neighboring active and late/dormant (ARS305, ARS300, ARS302-ARS303-ARS320) origins unaffected by Sic1 depletion, which correlate with the low GCR rate of this region. This suggests that deficient late/dormant backup origins, and thus deficient origin redundancy, rather than overall origin activity reduction is the relevant factor contributing to increase the instability of specific genomic regions.Figure 7Minor origin deficiency and ongoing DNA synthesis at ChrIII-L under Sic1 loss(A) 2D gels showing the firing activity of the indicated ARS in the ChrIII-L region of Sic1-wt cells (n = 1).

To analyze this, we quantified BrdU incorporation after bulk ChrIII-L replication completion by qPCR of amplicons distributed along the region (Figure 6A). As for ChrV-L, DNA synthesis initiated by the 7–55 min window at ARS305 and ARS306 (FUS1) (Figure 7F). No significant reduction of BrdU incorporation was detected along the region in Sic1 depleted cells in this time period. By the 145–205 min interval, we detected significantly higher incorporation at the FUS1 locus under Sic1 depletion (t-test p value 0.00687), consistent with deficient ARS306 activity (Figure 7G). Importantly, no significant BrdU incorporation occurred at CHA1 (t-test p value 0.21787) and ARS305 (p value 0.09513), which flank the GCR rate markers, suggesting that the region where instability is measured is not delayed in DNA synthesis completion. Overall, these data show that limited instability in ChrIII-L correlates with proficient activity of neighboring active and late/dormant origins, deficient firing of a single active origin, and minor delay in local DNA synthesis completion. Overall, these data argue for a major role for unequal deficiency among origins under premature S phase accounting for unequal instability rates and replication completion delays between different genomic regions.

Minor origin deficiency, ongoing DNA synthesis, and instability at ChrIII-L under Sic1 loss

To analyze whether differential origin deficiency unequally impacts replication completion and stability between genomic regions, we studied them in a second chromosome arm. In the left arm of chromosome III (ChrIII-L), the deletion of most active origins raises local GCR rates if dormant origins are also lost.33 We therefore studied how origin activity resulting from Sic1 depletion affects local replication and stability at this region. Similar to ChrV-L, ChrIII-L displays several origins toward the chromosome end, and two active efficient origins in the internal zone, ARS305 and ARS306 (Figure 6A). Since ARS305 is found to be resistant to Sic1 depletion, while ARS306 is sensitive,15,66 ChrIII-L mimics the situation of ChrV-L with one sensitive and one resistant out of two active origins. But in contrast to ChrV-L, the resistant ARS305 origin is positioned in ChrIII-L closer to the telomere than the sensitive ARS306 origin. To analyze the activity of ChrIII-L origins in Sic1 wt and Sic1 depletion conditions we re-probed 2D gel blots from Figure 1F (Figure 6B). We confirmed the resistance of ARS305 (bubble %, Sic1 wt: 67 ± 4.2; Sic1 depletion: 69 ± 4.0; t-test p value < 0.271568) and the sensitivity of ARS306 to Sic1 loss (bubble %, Sic1 wt: 70 ± 1.9; Sic1 depletion: 50 ± 8.7; t-test p value < 0.042684). Bubble arcs were undetected in ARS300, ARS301, and ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 2D gels in these conditions (Figures 6B and 6C). Overall, there was a 25% reduction of active origin firing in ChrIII-L under Sic1 depletion, similar to ChrV-L. To analyze how this origin deficiency correlated with instability we inserted in ChrIII-L the GCR assay markers used in ChrV-L (Figure 6A). Strikingly, Sic1 depleted cells showed a ChrIII-L GCR rate 4-fold higher that Sic1 wt cells (p value 0.0086) (Figure 6D), which is around 6 times less than in ChrV-L. These data show that ChrIII-L was more stable than ChrV-L under Sic1 loss, despite similar active origin deficiency.Figure 6Origin deficiency and gross rearrangement rates at ChrIII-L under Sic1 loss(A) Map of the first 100 kilobases of ChrIII-L region showing, to scale, the major known or likely ARS, the genes relevant for the GCR assay (URA3 and CAN1 markers, and the first essential gene from TEL03L, KRR1; see (D), and the position of the amplicons used in the qPCR analysis (see Figure 7G).(B) Representative 2D gels showing firing activity of the indicated ARS in asynchronous Sic1-wt or Sic1-depleted cells (n = 3).

The inactivity of ChrIII-L subtelomeric origins suggests no effect on local replication or stability, but limited origin activity can be undetected in 2D gels from asynchronous cells in contrast to synchronous cells, as shown for ChrV-L (see Figures 1F and 4C). To check this, and also to see how origin deficiency and instability correlate with replication progression along ChrIII-L, we re-probed the 2D blots used to analyze ChrV-L replication dynamics with probes of ChrIII-L origins (Figures 7A and 7B). We observed that ARS306 firing and replication timing were not affected by Sic1 depletion, as indicated by the presence of visible bubble and Y arcs in 2D gels at 40 min. ARS305 replication timing was also unaffected by Sic1 depletion, as replication forks at this locus were detectable in 2D gels by this time (note that the off-center position of the ARS305 locus within the 5.1 kb ClaI-ClaI DNA restriction fragment analyzed in these 2D gels −4.9 kb from 5′ and 0.1 kb from 3′- results in small bubble molecules, which do not generate a resolved bubble arc). This indicates that Sic1 depletion did not affect ChrIII-L replication timing in early or mid S phase, as in ChrV-L. Bubble arcs at ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 origins were now detected in synchronous cells from 55 to 100 min time-points, and at lower levels at ARS300 by 85 min, in both strains (Figures 7A–7C). Importantly, Sic1 depleted cells showed no activity reduction at these origins in comparison to Sic1 wt cells along the time-course (Figures 7C and 7D), showing that ARS300 and ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 are Sic1-depletion resistant origins. In addition, we did not detect backup firing at these origins (i.e., increased B-arc intensity regarding Sic1 wt conditions) under ARS306-deficient activity in Sic1 depleted cells, as would have been expected for redundant origins. This is consistent with dormant ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 backup activity only occurs under strong active origin failure, like ars305Δ or ars305Δ/ars306Δ,25 suggesting that ARS306 deficiency under Sic1 loss was insufficient to trigger ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 backup firing. The descending part of ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 Y-arc showed a fork pausing spot along the time-course (Figures 7A–7C). It corresponds to fork pausing at pre-replicative complexes present in these origins,81 indicating that spot intensity can be an estimate of origin licensing level. Figure 7E shows that the intensity of pausing spots maintained similar overall levels in both strains along the time-course. This suggests that ARS302-ARS303-ARS320 licensing was unaffected by Sic1 depletion. These data indicate that ChrIII-L concentrates a number of neighboring active and late/dormant (ARS305, ARS300, ARS302-ARS303-ARS320) origins unaffected by Sic1 depletion, which correlate with the low GCR rate of this region. This suggests that deficient late/dormant backup origins, and thus deficient origin redundancy, rather than overall origin activity reduction is the relevant factor contributing to increase the instability of specific genomic regions.Figure 7Minor origin deficiency and ongoing DNA synthesis at ChrIII-L under Sic1 loss(A) 2D gels showing the firing activity of the indicated ARS in the ChrIII-L region of Sic1-wt cells (n = 1).

In contrast to ARS507 in ChrV-L, we did not detect ongoing passive replication at ARS306 under Sic1 depletion, so that most replication intermediates disappeared by 100 min to Sic1 wt levels (Figures 7A–7C), suggesting no delay in bulk ChrIII-L replication completion by the end of S phase in Sic1 depleted cells. To analyze this, we quantified BrdU incorporation after bulk ChrIII-L replication completion by qPCR of amplicons distributed along the region (Figure 6A). As for ChrV-L, DNA synthesis initiated by the 7–55 min window at ARS305 and ARS306 (FUS1) (Figure 7F). No significant reduction of BrdU incorporation was detected along the region in Sic1 depleted cells in this time period. By the 145–205 min interval, we detected significantly higher incorporation at the FUS1 locus under Sic1 depletion (t-test p value 0.00687), consistent with deficient ARS306 activity (Figure 7G). Importantly, no significant BrdU incorporation occurred at CHA1 (t-test p value 0.21787) and ARS305 (p value 0.09513), which flank the GCR rate markers, suggesting that the region where instability is measured is not delayed in DNA synthesis completion. Overall, these data show that limited instability in ChrIII-L correlates with proficient activity of neighboring active and late/dormant origins, deficient firing of a single active origin, and minor delay in local DNA synthesis completion. Overall, these data argue for a major role for unequal deficiency among origins under premature S phase accounting for unequal instability rates and replication completion delays between different genomic regions.

DiscussionHere, we propose a mechanism by which the loss of CDK inhibition during G1 phase impairs chromosomal replication and stability unevenly between genomic regions. The underlying basis is the prevention of efficient firing activity at certain origins by Sic1 depletion, such that genomic regions exhibit uneven concentration of deficient origins. We exemplify this in two genomic regions. In the left chromosome V arm, decreased initiation events at the neighboring deficient active or dormant origins ARS507, ARS505, and ARS506 compromise origin redundancy (the compensation for active origin-deficiency by backup firing of dormant origins). As a result, DNA synthesis continues after bulk DNA replication completion across this region by the time of mitosis, leading to an increase in GCRs especially under local replication stress. Simultaneously, the left chromosome III arm shows the opposite conditions. Here, a single deficient active origin, ARS306, within a context of unaffected adjacent active and dormant origins ARS300, ARS302-ARS303-ARS320, and ARS305, triggers only minor incomplete DNA synthesis and low instability rates.The mechanism of genomic instability under CDK upregulation during G1 phase has been implied by previous research. Contributing factors include RPA reduction,82 dNTP deprival,60 origin under-activation,15,53,54 over-activation,83 or re-activation,72 or transcription-replication conflicts.61 Chromosomal instability in cancer cell lines or tumor cells shows patterns of heterogeneous incidence across the human genome.84,85 An essential open question is how such uneven instability can be generated. It could result from a variable combination of some or all of the above deficiencies across the genome, but whether a single defect is sufficient to induce a bias remains unknown. Origin paucity associates to instability of specific regions, such as human common fragile sites.38,86 Origin under-licensing also induces genomic replication and stability defects.32,34,36,41,87 In budding yeast, MCM2-7 mutation or depletion compromises origins heterogeneously to bias mini-chromosome stability and replication across the genome,48,50 suggesting a still unexplored source of non-uniform instability. Origin under-licensing and instability also correlate under deregulation of the pathways controlling timely S phase entry from yeast to human cells.15,53,54,55,66,88 In human RME1 cells, cyclin E overexpression induces under-replication, aberrant segregation, and instability at specific chromosomal regions, correlating with origin paucity,64 although origin density data are not derived from the same cells or from cyclin E overexpression. This leaves unclear whether biased phenotypes between genomic regions rely on unequal origin paucity across the genome. In RP1-hTert untransformed human cells, cyclin E overexpression preferentially under-licenses heterochromatin, which also shows increased RPA and 53BP1 recruitment, suggesting links between biased under-licensing and differential under-replication and DNA damage, at least to the scale of euchromatin and heterochromatin.89 Importantly, deregulated CDK inactivation during G1 phase in budding yeast biases activity reduction among individual origins.15,66 Thus, heterogeneous origin deficiency under CDK upregulation could potentially bias instability across the genome. This work addresses this pending question, revealing critical mechanistic insights.Forty per cent of studied origins reduce firing activity under Sic1 loss.66 We hypothesized that, unless an improbable uniform distribution of these origins across the genome, their concentration would vary among genomic regions. By testing this, we obtained data on two genomic regions, the left arms of chromosomes III and V. These regions are similar in terms of size, chromosome positioning (spanning from the left telomere inwards), and DNA replication profile (covering from earliest to latest replication within each chromosome).79 Also similar between both regions is the number of origins, the distribution patterns, and the firing timing (including the two earliest firing origins —ARS507-ARS508 and ARS305-ARS306— within their chromosomes, and several subtelomeric late/dormant origins79) (Figures 1A and 6A). Despite these similarities, our data reveal an opposite concentration of deficient origins between the two regions. Three out of four neighboring origin loci were either deficient or unaltered in ChrV-L or ChrIII-L, respectively (Figures 1F, 3C, 6B, 4C, 4D, and 7C). In spite of this variation, both regions showed a similar 25% reduction in origin firing activity. Since these regions showed differential levels of incomplete DNA synthesis and instability (Figures 1D, 4H, 6D, and 7G), this suggests that the number of deficient origins, rather than the overall reduction in activity, drives biased outcomes. We speculate that variable accumulation of deficient origins —virtually ranging from all to none—could occur across different genomic regions, creating an instability bias across the genome under deficient CDK inhibition.We propose that concentration of deficient origins is detrimental by decreasing origin redundancy. Active origins initiate DNA synthesis, while neighboring dormant origins remain inactive unless under local replication stress, when they provide backup firing,24,25,90 thus supporting redundancy. Our data show that under Sic1 loss, both deficient active and dormant origins concur in flanking positions on ChrV-L, compromising local origin redundancy and stability. This is due to halved activity of the early-firing active ARS507 origin (Figure 1F) and simultaneous deficient backup of the neighboring dormant ARS505 and ARS506 origins (Figures 1H and 3C), correlating with elevated local GCR rates (Figures 1D and 3D). This is consistent with low local GCR rate when ARS507 deficiency is accompanied by increased ARS505 activity under deficient CDK inactivation during G1 due to APC/C-Cdh1 loss.66 We confirmed the direct link between origin redundancy loss and instability by complementation assays. Suppressing either active (ars507Δ-ARS305) (Figure 1G) or dormant origin deficiency (sit1-ARS209(7x)) (Figure 1J), i.e., restoring each component of the redundant system, was sufficient to suppress most ChrV-L GCR rates (Figure 1D). Nevertheless, origin redundancy was not completely lost under Sic1 depletion, as deletion of either the active ARS507 or dormant ARS505 origins further increased GCR rates (Figure 1D). In contrast, ChrIII-L exhibited no compromised origin redundancy from the sole deficiency of ARS306 (Figure 6). Indeed, chromosome III remains stable even after deleting all active origins if dormant origins are present.33 We propose that decreased origin redundancy can ensue from deficient CDK inhibition in G1 phase to raise instability at genomic regions accumulating deficient active and dormant origins.The mechanism of deficient origin activity due to Sic1 loss likely relies on reduced licensing. Licensing only occurs in the cell cycle when CDK activity is absent, i.e. during G1 phase.3 CDK activity can block budding yeast licensing by phosphorylating and downregulating ORC, Cdc6, and MCM2-7,51,91 and partial CDK upregulation reduces licensing.53 Sic1 is expressed from late mitosis to the end of G1 phase, remaining stable until phosphorylation by CDK and degradation by SCF-Cdc4 in late G1, which allows S-CDK activation and the G1/S phase transition.19,92,93,94 Sic1 deletion induces premature S-CDK activation, thereby reducing the time available for origin licensing.14,15 S-CDK activity of Clb5,6/Cdc28 complexes likely depletes Cdc6 protein in late G1 phase in sic1Δ cells to reduce the activity of sic1-sensitive origins.15 Origins most sensitive to Sic1 loss, such as ARS505, ARS306, ARS416, ARS432, and ARS603,5, also exhibit reduced MCM binding under MCM4 depletion,50 suggesting that MCM reduction may also underly the origin activity bias under deregulated CDK inhibition. Deficient origins due to Sic1 loss would be those requiring higher MCM2-7 or Cdc6 levels in late G1 for efficient licensing. Consistent with this, we show that origins unaffected by Sic1 depletion show wild-type levels of fork pausing spots at pre-replicative complexes formed by MCM2-7 loading (Figure 7E, and see Figure S3B). We propose that CDK inhibition by Sic1 during G1 phase promotes efficient licensing at a subset of origins, allowing efficient origin redundancy, timely replication completion, and stability in certain genomic regions.We reasoned that a non-uniform reduction of origin activity and redundancy is likely not the only factor biasing instability across the genome under Sic1 depletion. Suppression of origin deficiency in ChrV-L reduced the GCR rate by up to two-thirds (Figure 1D). The remaining instability may be due to deficiencies in other origins on the chromosome, but could also stem from other causes. A plausible cause could be programmed or accidental impediments to replisome progression. In mammals, breakage of common fragile sites is associated with factors other than origin paucity, such as fork slowing.95,96,97,98 In yeast, fragile sites correlate with fork-pausing impediments, apart from depletion of MCM2-7 subunits.45,47,99,100 Our data show that replication fork pausing under origin deficiency in ChrV-L exacerbates the rate of local gross rearrangements in cells lacking Sic1 (Figure 3D). We interpret this as loss of initiation events and backup firing leaving local replication dependent on long-progressing forks from distant origins. As a result, replication can be highly sensitive to fork progression impediments, increasing the probability of under-replication and instability, as modeled.101 However, fork pausing could also be a potential source of GCRs, independent of reduced origin activity, since complementing dormant origin backup activity only partially suppressed GCR rates induced by fork pausing in Sic1-depleted cells (Figure 3D). Therefore, Sic1 depletion may contribute to GCRs not only by reducing origin firing but also by impairing the cellular response to local fork pausing events. Further work is needed to elucidate mechanism by which fork impediments induce instability in cells lacking Sic1 during G1 phase. We speculate that, under deficient CDK inhibition in G1 phase, differential coincidence of origin deficiency with accidental or programmed replication stress could further bias heterogeneous intragenomic instability throughout the genome.The probability of replication completion increases with evenly spaced origins, short inter-origin distances, and the presence of origins near chromosome ends.101 Our data suggests that these properties may be compromised in ChrV-L due to origin reduction under Sic1 loss, pointing out that ChrV-L could be prone to under-replication. Sic1 depletion induced dNTP incorporation between 45 and 105 min after bulk ChrV-L replication completion (Figure 4H). This very late ongoing DNA synthesis may reflect ongoing progression of functional replisomes reaching mitosis undetected. Supporting this, we found no signs of fork stalling, as evidenced by invariant RPA levels at replication forks (Figure 2A), by the absence of checkpoint activation (Figure 2B), and by absent slowed fork progression under Sic1 depletion (Figures 4C and 7B). Furthermore, the unaltered firing timing of deficient origins in Sic1-lacking cells rules out their contribution to delayed DNA replication completion. DNA synthesis in mitosis (MiDAS)65 occurs in human cancer cell lines exposed to replication stress,102,103 but also in unperturbed replication conditions after depletion of licensing proteins.40 In budding yeast, DNA synthesis in late mitosis occurs in unperturbed replication conditions, increasing in subtelomeric regions in correlation with high mutation rates, especially in sic1Δ cells.104 Cells lacking Sic1 also display deficient anaphase progression (Figure 5A).15 This supports the idea that increased under-replication due to deficient origin firing under Sic1 loss can reach mitosis and impair anaphase, contributing to the mechanism of GCRs. Therefore, a key point of this mechanism is whether genomic instability depends on unrestricted mitosis entry. We addressed this by analyzing the effects of delaying mitosis entry, thus providing additional time to facilitate the completion of ongoing DNA synthesis before mitosis. Slowed cell cycle progression stabilizes the yeast genome,105 and a slight delay in mitotic duration due to APC/C mutations can reduce chromosomal instability.106 We show that CLB2 deletion, which lowers M-CDK complexes and delays mitosis entry,80 suppressed both anaphase delay and GCRs under Sic1 loss (Figures 5A and 5E). Potentially, cyclin reduction could rescue Sic1 depletion by simply reducing CDK activity, thus suppressing G1-phase defects and their consequences. However, clb2Δ does not suppress plasmid loss of sic1 mutant cells,15 and G1 shortening and deficient origin activity were not suppressed in double Sic1-depletion clb2Δ mutants (Figures 5C and 5D), showing that instability suppression by CLB2 deletion was independent of G1 deficiency due to Sic1 loss. These findings strongly suggest that the concentration of deficient origins in a chromosomal region prevents chromosomal replication completion before mitosis. Consequently, incompletely replicated chromosomes hinder their segregation in anaphase, leading to chromosomal rearrangements. We propose that modulating mitosis entry can limit chromosomal instability in cells entering prematurely into S phase.Limitations of the studyThis report examines only two genomic regions to show that Sic1 depletion biases the number of defective replication origins, the levels of ongoing DNA synthesis during G2/M, and the rates of GCRs between them. These findings support the conclusion that the effects of Sic1 depletion are not uniform across the genome. However, as this is not a genome-wide study, it limits our understanding of the specific deficiencies that may occur at each genomic region.

Here, we propose a mechanism by which the loss of CDK inhibition during G1 phase impairs chromosomal replication and stability unevenly between genomic regions. The underlying basis is the prevention of efficient firing activity at certain origins by Sic1 depletion, such that genomic regions exhibit uneven concentration of deficient origins. We exemplify this in two genomic regions. In the left chromosome V arm, decreased initiation events at the neighboring deficient active or dormant origins ARS507, ARS505, and ARS506 compromise origin redundancy (the compensation for active origin-deficiency by backup firing of dormant origins). As a result, DNA synthesis continues after bulk DNA replication completion across this region by the time of mitosis, leading to an increase in GCRs especially under local replication stress. Simultaneously, the left chromosome III arm shows the opposite conditions. Here, a single deficient active origin, ARS306, within a context of unaffected adjacent active and dormant origins ARS300, ARS302-ARS303-ARS320, and ARS305, triggers only minor incomplete DNA synthesis and low instability rates.

Despite these similarities, our data reveal an opposite concentration of deficient origins between the two regions. Three out of four neighboring origin loci were either deficient or unaltered in ChrV-L or ChrIII-L, respectively (Figures 1F, 3C, 6B, 4C, 4D, and 7C). In spite of this variation, both regions showed a similar 25% reduction in origin firing activity. Since these regions showed differential levels of incomplete DNA synthesis and instability (Figures 1D, 4H, 6D, and 7G), this suggests that the number of deficient origins, rather than the overall reduction in activity, drives biased outcomes. We speculate that variable accumulation of deficient origins —virtually ranging from all to none—could occur across different genomic regions, creating an instability bias across the genome under deficient CDK inhibition.

Our data show that under Sic1 loss, both deficient active and dormant origins concur in flanking positions on ChrV-L, compromising local origin redundancy and stability. This is due to halved activity of the early-firing active ARS507 origin (Figure 1F) and simultaneous deficient backup of the neighboring dormant ARS505 and ARS506 origins (Figures 1H and 3C), correlating with elevated local GCR rates (Figures 1D and 3D). This is consistent with low local GCR rate when ARS507 deficiency is accompanied by increased ARS505 activity under deficient CDK inactivation during G1 due to APC/C-Cdh1 loss.66 We confirmed the direct link between origin redundancy loss and instability by complementation assays. Suppressing either active (ars507Δ-ARS305) (Figure 1G) or dormant origin deficiency (sit1-ARS209(7x)) (Figure 1J), i.e., restoring each component of the redundant system, was sufficient to suppress most ChrV-L GCR rates (Figure 1D). Nevertheless, origin redundancy was not completely lost under Sic1 depletion, as deletion of either the active ARS507 or dormant ARS505 origins further increased GCR rates (Figure 1D). In contrast, ChrIII-L exhibited no compromised origin redundancy from the sole deficiency of ARS306 (Figure 6). Indeed, chromosome III remains stable even after deleting all active origins if dormant origins are present.33 We propose that decreased origin redundancy can ensue from deficient CDK inhibition in G1 phase to raise instability at genomic regions accumulating deficient active and dormant origins.

Deficient origins due to Sic1 loss would be those requiring higher MCM2-7 or Cdc6 levels in late G1 for efficient licensing. Consistent with this, we show that origins unaffected by Sic1 depletion show wild-type levels of fork pausing spots at pre-replicative complexes formed by MCM2-7 loading (Figure 7E, and see Figure S3B). We propose that CDK inhibition by Sic1 during G1 phase promotes efficient licensing at a subset of origins, allowing efficient origin redundancy, timely replication completion, and stability in certain genomic regions.

We reasoned that a non-uniform reduction of origin activity and redundancy is likely not the only factor biasing instability across the genome under Sic1 depletion. Suppression of origin deficiency in ChrV-L reduced the GCR rate by up to two-thirds (Figure 1D).

As a result, replication can be highly sensitive to fork progression impediments, increasing the probability of under-replication and instability, as modeled.101 However, fork pausing could also be a potential source of GCRs, independent of reduced origin activity, since complementing dormant origin backup activity only partially suppressed GCR rates induced by fork pausing in Sic1-depleted cells (Figure 3D). Therefore, Sic1 depletion may contribute to GCRs not only by reducing origin firing but also by impairing the cellular response to local fork pausing events. Further work is needed to elucidate mechanism by which fork impediments induce instability in cells lacking Sic1 during G1 phase. We speculate that, under deficient CDK inhibition in G1 phase, differential coincidence of origin deficiency with accidental or programmed replication stress could further bias heterogeneous intragenomic instability throughout the genome.

The probability of replication completion increases with evenly spaced origins, short inter-origin distances, and the presence of origins near chromosome ends.101 Our data suggests that these properties may be compromised in ChrV-L due to origin reduction under Sic1 loss, pointing out that ChrV-L could be prone to under-replication. Sic1 depletion induced dNTP incorporation between 45 and 105 min after bulk ChrV-L replication completion (Figure 4H). This very late ongoing DNA synthesis may reflect ongoing progression of functional replisomes reaching mitosis undetected. Supporting this, we found no signs of fork stalling, as evidenced by invariant RPA levels at replication forks (Figure 2A), by the absence of checkpoint activation (Figure 2B), and by absent slowed fork progression under Sic1 depletion (Figures 4C and 7B). Furthermore, the unaltered firing timing of deficient origins in Sic1-lacking cells rules out their contribution to delayed DNA replication completion. DNA synthesis in mitosis (MiDAS)65 occurs in human cancer cell lines exposed to replication stress,102,103 but also in unperturbed replication conditions after depletion of licensing proteins.40 In budding yeast, DNA synthesis in late mitosis occurs in unperturbed replication conditions, increasing in subtelomeric regions in correlation with high mutation rates, especially in sic1Δ cells.104 Cells lacking Sic1 also display deficient anaphase progression (Figure 5A).15 This supports the idea that increased under-replication due to deficient origin firing under Sic1 loss can reach mitosis and impair anaphase, contributing to the mechanism of GCRs. Therefore, a key point of this mechanism is whether genomic instability depends on unrestricted mitosis entry. We addressed this by analyzing the effects of delaying mitosis entry, thus providing additional time to facilitate the completion of ongoing DNA synthesis before mitosis. Slowed cell cycle progression stabilizes the yeast genome,105 and a slight delay in mitotic duration due to APC/C mutations can reduce chromosomal instability.106 We show that CLB2 deletion, which lowers M-CDK complexes and delays mitosis entry,80 suppressed both anaphase delay and GCRs under Sic1 loss (Figures 5A and 5E). Potentially, cyclin reduction could rescue Sic1 depletion by simply reducing CDK activity, thus suppressing G1-phase defects and their consequences. However, clb2Δ does not suppress plasmid loss of sic1 mutant cells,15 and G1 shortening and deficient origin activity were not suppressed in double Sic1-depletion clb2Δ mutants (Figures 5C and 5D), showing that instability suppression by CLB2 deletion was independent of G1 deficiency due to Sic1 loss. These findings strongly suggest that the concentration of deficient origins in a chromosomal region prevents chromosomal replication completion before mitosis. Consequently, incompletely replicated chromosomes hinder their segregation in anaphase, leading to chromosomal rearrangements. We propose that modulating mitosis entry can limit chromosomal instability in cells entering prematurely into S phase.

Limitations of the studyThis report examines only two genomic regions to show that Sic1 depletion biases the number of defective replication origins, the levels of ongoing DNA synthesis during G2/M, and the rates of GCRs between them. These findings support the conclusion that the effects of Sic1 depletion are not uniform across the genome. However, as this is not a genome-wide study, it limits our understanding of the specific deficiencies that may occur at each genomic region.

Experimental model and study participant detailsYeast strains and growth conditionsThe budding yeast strains used here are based on the S288C background (strain RDKY3615 kindly provided by R.D. Kolodner,68 or the W303-1a background (K. Labib’s laboratory) as indicated (see Table S2). Cells were grown at 25°C in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) supplemented with 40 ng/mL adenine (YPA), 2% glucose (YPAD), or 1% raffinose plus 0.3% galactose (YPARG). To synchronize cells in the cell cycle, nocodazole inhibitor of microtubule assembly (final concentration 15 mg/mL), or hydroxyurea inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (25 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) were added. To deplete the Sic1 protein in GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells, which carry the only genomic SIC1 gene under the GAL1,10 promoter,66 cells were grown in YPARG medium and then centrifuged before resuspending in YPAD medium for 4 h in asynchronous cell cultures. The thymidine analogue 5-bromo-2′- deoxyuridine (BrdU) was added to 200 mg/mL.77Method detailsConstruction of chromosomal ARS modificationsTo construct yeast cells lacking ARS507 origin (ars507Δ-kanMX6), we replaced 234 pb containing the ARS507 sequence with the kanMX6 marker amplified by PCR from the pFA6a-kanMX6 plasmid,108 and adding 50bp on each end corresponding to nucleotides 59233-59283 and 59466-59516 of chromosome V. We then transformed YAC177 cells, and checked correct chromosomal DNA replacement by PCR. By the same approach, we replaced the chromosome V nucleotides 10425-12929 with the LEU2 marker from pRS305 plasmid109 to construct ars505Δ-LEU2 cells. To construct sit1::pRS305-ARS209(7X) cells, a SphI-BoxI fragment from the pDK368-7 plasmid (ARS209 originally referred to as H4 ARS)107 was subcloned into SphI-HincII pTZ19R to construct pTZ19R-ARS209(7X). From this, a XbaI-HindIII ARS209(7X)-containing fragment was then cloned into XbaI-HindIII linearised pRS305-SIT1 plasmid that at SalI-HindIII carries a SIT1 fragment corresponding to chromosome V nucleotides 27692-29067, to obtain pRS305-SIT1-ARS209(7X). Linearised pRS305-SIT1 and pRS305-SIT1-ARS209(7X) with NheI were integrated in monocopy at chromosomal SIT1 in YAC177 or in YAC217 (to generate sit1-empty or sit1-ARS209(7X) strains, respectively). pRS303-SIT1-ARS209(7X) was constructed by inserting a XbaI-ApaI SIT1-ARS209(7X) fragment from pRS305-SIT1-ARS209(7X) into the pRS303 plasmid,109 and pRS303-SIT1 was constructed by inserting the BamHI-SalI fragment from pRS305-SIT1 into pRS303. pRS303-SIT1 and pRS303-SIT1-ARS209(7X) plasmid were linearized with XcmI and integrated in monocopy at chromosomal SIT1 in YAC1296 or in YAC1299 (to generate sit1-empty or sit1-ARS209(7X) strains, respectively). W303-1a cdc15-2 YAC1104 and YAC1107 cells were constructed by crossing K1993 W303-1a cdc15-2 cells110 with W303-1a MATa cdh1Δ::HIS3 sic1::(TRP1)GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells. To construct yeast strains with a RFB from the rDNA on chromosome V, a LEU2-RFB cassette was obtained from pBH327 by PCR amplification with oligonucleotides containing flanking nucleotides to 42218-42341 of chromosome V. The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector System I (Promega), which was used to replace nucleotides 42218-42341 of chromosome V. To delete CLB2, cells were transformed with a PCR-amplified HIS3 marker from the pRS303 plasmid using primers containing flanking regions to the CLB2 open reading frame (nucleotides 771653-773128 of chromosome XVI).Flow cytometry analysisFor Flow Cytometry, 0.3 mL of cell culture were fixed in 0.7 mL of 100% ethanol. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50mM Sodium Citrate containing 0.2 mg/mL RNAse, and incubated overnight at 37°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50mM Sodium Citrate 50mM HCl containing 5 mg/mL pepsin, sonicated, analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) or a CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter), and plotted using the BD Cell Quest (Becton Dickinson) or the FlowJo softwares.2D DNA gelsGenomic DNA samples for two-dimensional neutral-neutral agarose gel electrophoresis were prepared and analyzed as described previously.66 DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes Bsu15I-SacI-KpnI (BSK digestion) to prepare 2D blots for the sequential analysis of ARS507, ARS508, ARS300, and ARS306; MluI-ClaI (MC digestion), for 2D blots of ARS503-504, ARS505, ARS506, ARS302-303-320, and ARS305; or HindIII-EcoRV-BclI for ARS301, ARS304, and ARS305. DNA in these blots were detected using the following probes amplified using the indicated primers (listed in Table S3): ARS503-504 chromosome (chr) V nucleotides 8919-9432; ARS505 and ars505Δ-LEU2, chrV:10744-11272; ARS506, chrV:18213-18663; ARS507 and ars507Δ-ARS305, chrV:59965-60438; ARS508, chrV:92964-93372; sit1-pRS303, and sit1-pRS305 +/− ARS209(7X), pRS305:2588-3003; ARS300, chrIII 2277-2799; ARS301 chrIII:11228-11485; ARS302-303-320 chrIII:14040-14991; ARS304 chrIII:27940-28817; ARS305, chrIII:39073-40557, ARS306, chrIII:73049-73958; ChrV-L-RFB, chrV:42776-43477; CIN8, chrV:39206-39535; ARS522, chrV:548689-549857. To re-hybridise 2D blots, probes were stripped by washing nylon membranes twice in 0.1M NaOH at 42.5°C during 5 min, and once in 0.1X SSC buffer (15mM NaCl, 15mM sodium citrate dihydrate) at 25°C during 15 min. After hybridisation, 2D blots were exposed to BAS-MS imaging plates (Fujifilm), and signal was detected using a PMI FX Phosphorimager and the QuantityOne or Image Lab softwares (Bio-Rad) as described.66 Image signal was transformed to levels showing arc signals using the “Image transform” tool of the QuantityOne software. This changes only the view of the data but not the data itself, such that signal quantification is not affected. To quantify the signal of B- and Y-arcs, or of pausing spots, we followed the procedure explained in the Figure S2. Contrast and brightness of whole 2D gel images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop CS5.GCR assayGrowth of Sic1 wt and Sic1 depleted cells and fluctuation analysis were performed as described66,68 with some modifications. At least five whole independent cell colonies grown in YPARG plates were inoculated independently on appropriate volumes of YPAD (depending on the expected mutations per culture; 70 mL for Sic1 wt cells, and 2–5 mL for Sic1 depletion conditions) at approximately 2.5 × 105 cells/mL, and were grown at 25°C until stationary phase for 36 h. Total cell number was estimated by direct cell counting using a Thoma cell counting chamber. A cell aliquot per culture was inoculated in YPARG or YPAD plates to estimate total viable cells (N). All remaining cells were plated in aliquots of 5 × 108 cells per 150mm wide Petri dish of synthetic minimal 5-FOA+canavanine (1.1 g/L of 5-FOA, 60 mg/mL of sulfate salt L-canavanine) supplemented with 0.3% galactose and 1% of raffinose, and incubated for 10 days at 25°C. The number of observed mutant colonies (r) was counted.Immunofluorescence and DAPI stainingMicrotubules were detected by tubulin staining with the anti-a-tubulin antibody. DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) was used to stain nuclear DNA. The percentage of cells with anaphase spindles (>2 mm) was obtained by counting at least 100 cells in each experiment. 5 × 107 asynchronous cells growing in early log phase were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (room temperature, 1 h) and washed twice with 1x PEM (1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM EGTA, 100 mM PIPES-HCl pH 6.9) by centrifugation (3220 xg, room temperature, 1 min). Cells were sonicated (5 s), centrifuged (4500 xg, room temperature, 1 min), and incubated (37°C) in 1 mL PEMS-digestion (1x PEM, 1.2 M sorbitol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% glusulase, 25 mg/mL zymolyase 20T) for cell wall digestion (usually 15–40 min). Cells were washed 3 times with 1x PEMS (1x PEM, 1.2 M sorbitol) and incubated (30 s) in 1 mL PEMS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. For tubulin staining, cells were washed 3 times with 1 mL PEMBAL (1x PEM, 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin), 10 mM lysine-HCl, 0.1% NaN3 pH 6.9), centrifuged, and incubated (4°C, overnight) in PEMBAL with the appropriated antibody. Cells were washed twice with 1mL PEMBAL supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, once with 1 mL PEMBAL, centrifuged, and incubated (37°C, 1 h) with the secondary Cy3-conjugated affinipure anti-mouse antibody in PEMBAL solution. Cells were washed as before and suspended in 1xPBS. For microscopic examination, a drop of cell solution was mixed with DAPI to stain nuclear DNA, mounted on a microscope slide, covered with mounting medium containing anti-fade solution (p-phenylendiamine), and the cover slip sealed. Fluorescence was detected using a Leica DM RXA microscope and phase contrast, or DAPI and TxRed fluorescence filters.Immunoblotting and in situ kinase assayProtein extracts were prepared by the TCA method.66 Sic1 was detected with anti-Sic1 antibody, Pgk1 with anti-Pgk1, and Rad53 with anti-Rad53. Ponceau S staining was used as loading control for some immunoblots. In situ Rad53 autophosphorylation assay was performed as described.111 Secondary antibodies were HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-labelled whole anti-rabbit, HRP-whole anti-mouse, or HRP-whole anti-goat.ChIP and quantitative real-time PCRCultures of cells grown in presence of BrdU were treated with a solution of 10% sodium azide (0.1% of final concentration), centrifuged (3220 xg, 4°C, 5 min), washed with 20 mL of sterile distilled cold water (3220 xg, 4°C, 5 min), and dry cell pellets were stored at −20°C. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method to isolate replication intermediates for 2D gels. The immunoprecipitation of BrdU-containing chromatin was done as described80 with some modifications. DNA was sonicated to an average DNA fragment around 300 bp in length and denatured. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G, Invitrogen) were prepared by washing and resuspending 10 μL of Dynabeads in 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. Specific anti-BrdU antibodies were attached to the magnetic beads. For DNA immunoprecipitation, magnetic antibody-beads were added to denatured DNA (100°C for 10 min and rapidly chilled on ice) samples followed by incubation at 4°C, overnight. One eightieth of the solution was kept to process the INPUT fraction. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed twice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.,5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1X COMPLETE w/o EDTA antiproteolytic cocktail), twice in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, twice in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and once in TE 1X pH 8.0. Chromatin was then eluted from the magnetic beads in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). INPUT and IP samples were treated with 0.5 mg/mL proteinase K and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by DNA purification with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and glycogen, and INPUT and IP DNA was resuspended in 10 μL of distilled sterile water.Rfa1-9xPK ChIP was performed as described.112 Briefly, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed with cold TBS and disrupted with glass beads. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G, Invitrogen) were prepared by washing and resuspending 15 μL of Dynabeads in 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA. Specific anti-V5-tag antibodies were attached to the magnetic beads by incubation at 4°C, overnight. Chromatin was sonicated to an average DNA fragment size around 300 bp in length. One ninetieth of the solution was kept to process the INPUT fraction. For chromatin immunoprecipitation, magnetic antibody-beads were washed with 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA, and added to sonicated DNA samples followed by incubation at 4°C, overnight. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed twice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.,5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1X COMPLETE w/o EDTA antiproteolytic cocktail), twice in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, twice in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and once in TE 1X pH 8.0. Protein-DNA was eluted from the magnetic beads in elution buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10mM EDTA, 1% SDS). ChIP and INPUT samples was incubated at 65°C overnight to reverse DNA-protein crosslink, and then were treated with proteinase K, purified with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. DNA pellets were resuspended in 1X TE with 0.3 mg/mL RNase A and purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Real time PCR was performed following a standard protocol. 4–8 ng of IPed or INPUT DNA from biological triplicates were amplified using FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche) and a LightCycler96 machine (Roche). The PCR program (50 cycles of 95°C 10 s, 60°C 30 s, 72°C 30 s) was designed to amplify regions close to replication origins in chromosomes V and III using the following primer pairs (listed in Table S3): SPF1, 5′ ARS508 pair 2 - 3′ ARS508 pair 2; MAK10, 5′ ARS507 pair 2 - 3′ ARS507 pair 2; ARS503, 5′ ARS503-504 pair 2 - 3′ ARS503-504 pair 2; FUS1, 5′ ARS306 pair 1 - 3′ ARS306 pair 1; ARS305, 305 Fw - 305 Rev; CHA1, 5′ ARS302-320 pair 1 - 3′ ARS302-320 pair 1; ARS300, 5′ ARS300 pair 1 - 3′ ARS300 pair 1; ARS306, ARS306 Fwd - ARS306 Rev; ARS507, 5′ ARS507 pair 1 - 3′ ARS507 pair 1; ARS508, 5′ ARS508 pair 2 - 3′ ARS508 pair 2. Values resulting from amplification were used to calculate the fold increase of protein-associated nascent DNA (amount of IPed DNA in respect to INPUT DNA). Mean cycle threshold (Ct) values from triplicate qPCR reactions were used to calculate the fold increase using the formula 2e(Ct IP - Ct INPUT)/90.113 Data was represented as % of IP DNA in respect to INPUT data. The non-replicated region ARS300 was used to normalize the chipped Rfa1-9xPK signal at replicated regions (ARS306, ARS507, ARS305, and ARS508).Quantification and statistical analysisFor 2D-gels bubble % estimation data from asynchronous cell cultures mean and standard deviation values for three independent experiments are represented. Statistical significance of bubble % means was assessed by the two-tailed test. Specific information about n (biological replicates) and p values, and significance, can be found in figure legends and in results.For GCR assay data, values of r and N were used to estimate the GCR rates using the Ma-Sandri-Sarkar Maximum Likelihood (MSS-MLE) method by the Fluctuation AnaLysis CalculatOR program (FALCOR), and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.114,115 Fluctuation assays done with the same final number of cells in cultures can be statistically compared. We analyzed significant differences between ln(m)’s (being m the probable number of mutations estimated per culture) (see Table S1) by a standard independent two-tailed t-test as indicated.114 Therefore, we only compared statistical significant variation between Sic1 wt, or Sic1 depletion data.For qPCR-ChIP amplification data, mean and standard deviation values for three independent experiments are represented. Statistical significance of BrdU or Rfa1 mean enrichment over the input was assessed by the two-tailed test. Specific information about n (biological replicates) and p values, and significance, can be found in figure legends and in results.

Method detailsConstruction of chromosomal ARS modificationsTo construct yeast cells lacking ARS507 origin (ars507Δ-kanMX6), we replaced 234 pb containing the ARS507 sequence with the kanMX6 marker amplified by PCR from the pFA6a-kanMX6 plasmid,108 and adding 50bp on each end corresponding to nucleotides 59233-59283 and 59466-59516 of chromosome V. We then transformed YAC177 cells, and checked correct chromosomal DNA replacement by PCR. By the same approach, we replaced the chromosome V nucleotides 10425-12929 with the LEU2 marker from pRS305 plasmid109 to construct ars505Δ-LEU2 cells. To construct sit1::pRS305-ARS209(7X) cells, a SphI-BoxI fragment from the pDK368-7 plasmid (ARS209 originally referred to as H4 ARS)107 was subcloned into SphI-HincII pTZ19R to construct pTZ19R-ARS209(7X). From this, a XbaI-HindIII ARS209(7X)-containing fragment was then cloned into XbaI-HindIII linearised pRS305-SIT1 plasmid that at SalI-HindIII carries a SIT1 fragment corresponding to chromosome V nucleotides 27692-29067, to obtain pRS305-SIT1-ARS209(7X). Linearised pRS305-SIT1 and pRS305-SIT1-ARS209(7X) with NheI were integrated in monocopy at chromosomal SIT1 in YAC177 or in YAC217 (to generate sit1-empty or sit1-ARS209(7X) strains, respectively). pRS303-SIT1-ARS209(7X) was constructed by inserting a XbaI-ApaI SIT1-ARS209(7X) fragment from pRS305-SIT1-ARS209(7X) into the pRS303 plasmid,109 and pRS303-SIT1 was constructed by inserting the BamHI-SalI fragment from pRS305-SIT1 into pRS303. pRS303-SIT1 and pRS303-SIT1-ARS209(7X) plasmid were linearized with XcmI and integrated in monocopy at chromosomal SIT1 in YAC1296 or in YAC1299 (to generate sit1-empty or sit1-ARS209(7X) strains, respectively). W303-1a cdc15-2 YAC1104 and YAC1107 cells were constructed by crossing K1993 W303-1a cdc15-2 cells110 with W303-1a MATa cdh1Δ::HIS3 sic1::(TRP1)GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells. To construct yeast strains with a RFB from the rDNA on chromosome V, a LEU2-RFB cassette was obtained from pBH327 by PCR amplification with oligonucleotides containing flanking nucleotides to 42218-42341 of chromosome V. The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector System I (Promega), which was used to replace nucleotides 42218-42341 of chromosome V. To delete CLB2, cells were transformed with a PCR-amplified HIS3 marker from the pRS303 plasmid using primers containing flanking regions to the CLB2 open reading frame (nucleotides 771653-773128 of chromosome XVI).Flow cytometry analysisFor Flow Cytometry, 0.3 mL of cell culture were fixed in 0.7 mL of 100% ethanol. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50mM Sodium Citrate containing 0.2 mg/mL RNAse, and incubated overnight at 37°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50mM Sodium Citrate 50mM HCl containing 5 mg/mL pepsin, sonicated, analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) or a CytoFLEX (Beckman Coulter), and plotted using the BD Cell Quest (Becton Dickinson) or the FlowJo softwares.2D DNA gelsGenomic DNA samples for two-dimensional neutral-neutral agarose gel electrophoresis were prepared and analyzed as described previously.66 DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes Bsu15I-SacI-KpnI (BSK digestion) to prepare 2D blots for the sequential analysis of ARS507, ARS508, ARS300, and ARS306; MluI-ClaI (MC digestion), for 2D blots of ARS503-504, ARS505, ARS506, ARS302-303-320, and ARS305; or HindIII-EcoRV-BclI for ARS301, ARS304, and ARS305. DNA in these blots were detected using the following probes amplified using the indicated primers (listed in Table S3): ARS503-504 chromosome (chr) V nucleotides 8919-9432; ARS505 and ars505Δ-LEU2, chrV:10744-11272; ARS506, chrV:18213-18663; ARS507 and ars507Δ-ARS305, chrV:59965-60438; ARS508, chrV:92964-93372; sit1-pRS303, and sit1-pRS305 +/− ARS209(7X), pRS305:2588-3003; ARS300, chrIII 2277-2799; ARS301 chrIII:11228-11485; ARS302-303-320 chrIII:14040-14991; ARS304 chrIII:27940-28817; ARS305, chrIII:39073-40557, ARS306, chrIII:73049-73958; ChrV-L-RFB, chrV:42776-43477; CIN8, chrV:39206-39535; ARS522, chrV:548689-549857. To re-hybridise 2D blots, probes were stripped by washing nylon membranes twice in 0.1M NaOH at 42.5°C during 5 min, and once in 0.1X SSC buffer (15mM NaCl, 15mM sodium citrate dihydrate) at 25°C during 15 min. After hybridisation, 2D blots were exposed to BAS-MS imaging plates (Fujifilm), and signal was detected using a PMI FX Phosphorimager and the QuantityOne or Image Lab softwares (Bio-Rad) as described.66 Image signal was transformed to levels showing arc signals using the “Image transform” tool of the QuantityOne software. This changes only the view of the data but not the data itself, such that signal quantification is not affected. To quantify the signal of B- and Y-arcs, or of pausing spots, we followed the procedure explained in the Figure S2. Contrast and brightness of whole 2D gel images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop CS5.GCR assayGrowth of Sic1 wt and Sic1 depleted cells and fluctuation analysis were performed as described66,68 with some modifications. At least five whole independent cell colonies grown in YPARG plates were inoculated independently on appropriate volumes of YPAD (depending on the expected mutations per culture; 70 mL for Sic1 wt cells, and 2–5 mL for Sic1 depletion conditions) at approximately 2.5 × 105 cells/mL, and were grown at 25°C until stationary phase for 36 h. Total cell number was estimated by direct cell counting using a Thoma cell counting chamber. A cell aliquot per culture was inoculated in YPARG or YPAD plates to estimate total viable cells (N). All remaining cells were plated in aliquots of 5 × 108 cells per 150mm wide Petri dish of synthetic minimal 5-FOA+canavanine (1.1 g/L of 5-FOA, 60 mg/mL of sulfate salt L-canavanine) supplemented with 0.3% galactose and 1% of raffinose, and incubated for 10 days at 25°C. The number of observed mutant colonies (r) was counted.Immunofluorescence and DAPI stainingMicrotubules were detected by tubulin staining with the anti-a-tubulin antibody. DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) was used to stain nuclear DNA. The percentage of cells with anaphase spindles (>2 mm) was obtained by counting at least 100 cells in each experiment. 5 × 107 asynchronous cells growing in early log phase were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (room temperature, 1 h) and washed twice with 1x PEM (1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM EGTA, 100 mM PIPES-HCl pH 6.9) by centrifugation (3220 xg, room temperature, 1 min). Cells were sonicated (5 s), centrifuged (4500 xg, room temperature, 1 min), and incubated (37°C) in 1 mL PEMS-digestion (1x PEM, 1.2 M sorbitol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% glusulase, 25 mg/mL zymolyase 20T) for cell wall digestion (usually 15–40 min). Cells were washed 3 times with 1x PEMS (1x PEM, 1.2 M sorbitol) and incubated (30 s) in 1 mL PEMS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. For tubulin staining, cells were washed 3 times with 1 mL PEMBAL (1x PEM, 1% BSA (bovine serum albumin), 10 mM lysine-HCl, 0.1% NaN3 pH 6.9), centrifuged, and incubated (4°C, overnight) in PEMBAL with the appropriated antibody. Cells were washed twice with 1mL PEMBAL supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, once with 1 mL PEMBAL, centrifuged, and incubated (37°C, 1 h) with the secondary Cy3-conjugated affinipure anti-mouse antibody in PEMBAL solution. Cells were washed as before and suspended in 1xPBS. For microscopic examination, a drop of cell solution was mixed with DAPI to stain nuclear DNA, mounted on a microscope slide, covered with mounting medium containing anti-fade solution (p-phenylendiamine), and the cover slip sealed. Fluorescence was detected using a Leica DM RXA microscope and phase contrast, or DAPI and TxRed fluorescence filters.Immunoblotting and in situ kinase assayProtein extracts were prepared by the TCA method.66 Sic1 was detected with anti-Sic1 antibody, Pgk1 with anti-Pgk1, and Rad53 with anti-Rad53. Ponceau S staining was used as loading control for some immunoblots. In situ Rad53 autophosphorylation assay was performed as described.111 Secondary antibodies were HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-labelled whole anti-rabbit, HRP-whole anti-mouse, or HRP-whole anti-goat.ChIP and quantitative real-time PCRCultures of cells grown in presence of BrdU were treated with a solution of 10% sodium azide (0.1% of final concentration), centrifuged (3220 xg, 4°C, 5 min), washed with 20 mL of sterile distilled cold water (3220 xg, 4°C, 5 min), and dry cell pellets were stored at −20°C. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method to isolate replication intermediates for 2D gels. The immunoprecipitation of BrdU-containing chromatin was done as described80 with some modifications. DNA was sonicated to an average DNA fragment around 300 bp in length and denatured. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G, Invitrogen) were prepared by washing and resuspending 10 μL of Dynabeads in 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. Specific anti-BrdU antibodies were attached to the magnetic beads. For DNA immunoprecipitation, magnetic antibody-beads were added to denatured DNA (100°C for 10 min and rapidly chilled on ice) samples followed by incubation at 4°C, overnight. One eightieth of the solution was kept to process the INPUT fraction. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed twice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.,5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1X COMPLETE w/o EDTA antiproteolytic cocktail), twice in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, twice in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and once in TE 1X pH 8.0. Chromatin was then eluted from the magnetic beads in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). INPUT and IP samples were treated with 0.5 mg/mL proteinase K and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by DNA purification with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and glycogen, and INPUT and IP DNA was resuspended in 10 μL of distilled sterile water.Rfa1-9xPK ChIP was performed as described.112 Briefly, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed with cold TBS and disrupted with glass beads. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G, Invitrogen) were prepared by washing and resuspending 15 μL of Dynabeads in 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA. Specific anti-V5-tag antibodies were attached to the magnetic beads by incubation at 4°C, overnight. Chromatin was sonicated to an average DNA fragment size around 300 bp in length. One ninetieth of the solution was kept to process the INPUT fraction. For chromatin immunoprecipitation, magnetic antibody-beads were washed with 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA, and added to sonicated DNA samples followed by incubation at 4°C, overnight. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed twice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.,5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1X COMPLETE w/o EDTA antiproteolytic cocktail), twice in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, twice in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and once in TE 1X pH 8.0. Protein-DNA was eluted from the magnetic beads in elution buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10mM EDTA, 1% SDS). ChIP and INPUT samples was incubated at 65°C overnight to reverse DNA-protein crosslink, and then were treated with proteinase K, purified with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. DNA pellets were resuspended in 1X TE with 0.3 mg/mL RNase A and purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Real time PCR was performed following a standard protocol. 4–8 ng of IPed or INPUT DNA from biological triplicates were amplified using FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche) and a LightCycler96 machine (Roche). The PCR program (50 cycles of 95°C 10 s, 60°C 30 s, 72°C 30 s) was designed to amplify regions close to replication origins in chromosomes V and III using the following primer pairs (listed in Table S3): SPF1, 5′ ARS508 pair 2 - 3′ ARS508 pair 2; MAK10, 5′ ARS507 pair 2 - 3′ ARS507 pair 2; ARS503, 5′ ARS503-504 pair 2 - 3′ ARS503-504 pair 2; FUS1, 5′ ARS306 pair 1 - 3′ ARS306 pair 1; ARS305, 305 Fw - 305 Rev; CHA1, 5′ ARS302-320 pair 1 - 3′ ARS302-320 pair 1; ARS300, 5′ ARS300 pair 1 - 3′ ARS300 pair 1; ARS306, ARS306 Fwd - ARS306 Rev; ARS507, 5′ ARS507 pair 1 - 3′ ARS507 pair 1; ARS508, 5′ ARS508 pair 2 - 3′ ARS508 pair 2. Values resulting from amplification were used to calculate the fold increase of protein-associated nascent DNA (amount of IPed DNA in respect to INPUT DNA). Mean cycle threshold (Ct) values from triplicate qPCR reactions were used to calculate the fold increase using the formula 2e(Ct IP - Ct INPUT)/90.113 Data was represented as % of IP DNA in respect to INPUT data. The non-replicated region ARS300 was used to normalize the chipped Rfa1-9xPK signal at replicated regions (ARS306, ARS507, ARS305, and ARS508).

Linearised pRS305-SIT1 and pRS305-SIT1-ARS209(7X) with NheI were integrated in monocopy at chromosomal SIT1 in YAC177 or in YAC217 (to generate sit1-empty or sit1-ARS209(7X) strains, respectively). pRS303-SIT1-ARS209(7X) was constructed by inserting a XbaI-ApaI SIT1-ARS209(7X) fragment from pRS305-SIT1-ARS209(7X) into the pRS303 plasmid,109 and pRS303-SIT1 was constructed by inserting the BamHI-SalI fragment from pRS305-SIT1 into pRS303. pRS303-SIT1 and pRS303-SIT1-ARS209(7X) plasmid were linearized with XcmI and integrated in monocopy at chromosomal SIT1 in YAC1296 or in YAC1299 (to generate sit1-empty or sit1-ARS209(7X) strains, respectively). W303-1a cdc15-2 YAC1104 and YAC1107 cells were constructed by crossing K1993 W303-1a cdc15-2 cells110 with W303-1a MATa cdh1Δ::HIS3 sic1::(TRP1)GAL1,10p-SIC1 cells. To construct yeast strains with a RFB from the rDNA on chromosome V, a LEU2-RFB cassette was obtained from pBH327 by PCR amplification with oligonucleotides containing flanking nucleotides to 42218-42341 of chromosome V. The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector System I (Promega), which was used to replace nucleotides 42218-42341 of chromosome V. To delete CLB2, cells were transformed with a PCR-amplified HIS3 marker from the pRS303 plasmid using primers containing flanking regions to the CLB2 open reading frame (nucleotides 771653-773128 of chromosome XVI).

2D DNA gelsGenomic DNA samples for two-dimensional neutral-neutral agarose gel electrophoresis were prepared and analyzed as described previously.66 DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes Bsu15I-SacI-KpnI (BSK digestion) to prepare 2D blots for the sequential analysis of ARS507, ARS508, ARS300, and ARS306; MluI-ClaI (MC digestion), for 2D blots of ARS503-504, ARS505, ARS506, ARS302-303-320, and ARS305; or HindIII-EcoRV-BclI for ARS301, ARS304, and ARS305. DNA in these blots were detected using the following probes amplified using the indicated primers (listed in Table S3): ARS503-504 chromosome (chr) V nucleotides 8919-9432; ARS505 and ars505Δ-LEU2, chrV:10744-11272; ARS506, chrV:18213-18663; ARS507 and ars507Δ-ARS305, chrV:59965-60438; ARS508, chrV:92964-93372; sit1-pRS303, and sit1-pRS305 +/− ARS209(7X), pRS305:2588-3003; ARS300, chrIII 2277-2799; ARS301 chrIII:11228-11485; ARS302-303-320 chrIII:14040-14991; ARS304 chrIII:27940-28817; ARS305, chrIII:39073-40557, ARS306, chrIII:73049-73958; ChrV-L-RFB, chrV:42776-43477; CIN8, chrV:39206-39535; ARS522, chrV:548689-549857. To re-hybridise 2D blots, probes were stripped by washing nylon membranes twice in 0.1M NaOH at 42.5°C during 5 min, and once in 0.1X SSC buffer (15mM NaCl, 15mM sodium citrate dihydrate) at 25°C during 15 min. After hybridisation, 2D blots were exposed to BAS-MS imaging plates (Fujifilm), and signal was detected using a PMI FX Phosphorimager and the QuantityOne or Image Lab softwares (Bio-Rad) as described.66 Image signal was transformed to levels showing arc signals using the “Image transform” tool of the QuantityOne software. This changes only the view of the data but not the data itself, such that signal quantification is not affected. To quantify the signal of B- and Y-arcs, or of pausing spots, we followed the procedure explained in the Figure S2. Contrast and brightness of whole 2D gel images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop CS5.

GCR assayGrowth of Sic1 wt and Sic1 depleted cells and fluctuation analysis were performed as described66,68 with some modifications. At least five whole independent cell colonies grown in YPARG plates were inoculated independently on appropriate volumes of YPAD (depending on the expected mutations per culture; 70 mL for Sic1 wt cells, and 2–5 mL for Sic1 depletion conditions) at approximately 2.5 × 105 cells/mL, and were grown at 25°C until stationary phase for 36 h. Total cell number was estimated by direct cell counting using a Thoma cell counting chamber. A cell aliquot per culture was inoculated in YPARG or YPAD plates to estimate total viable cells (N). All remaining cells were plated in aliquots of 5 × 108 cells per 150mm wide Petri dish of synthetic minimal 5-FOA+canavanine (1.1 g/L of 5-FOA, 60 mg/mL of sulfate salt L-canavanine) supplemented with 0.3% galactose and 1% of raffinose, and incubated for 10 days at 25°C. The number of observed mutant colonies (r) was counted.

Cells were washed as before and suspended in 1xPBS. For microscopic examination, a drop of cell solution was mixed with DAPI to stain nuclear DNA, mounted on a microscope slide, covered with mounting medium containing anti-fade solution (p-phenylendiamine), and the cover slip sealed. Fluorescence was detected using a Leica DM RXA microscope and phase contrast, or DAPI and TxRed fluorescence filters.

ChIP and quantitative real-time PCRCultures of cells grown in presence of BrdU were treated with a solution of 10% sodium azide (0.1% of final concentration), centrifuged (3220 xg, 4°C, 5 min), washed with 20 mL of sterile distilled cold water (3220 xg, 4°C, 5 min), and dry cell pellets were stored at −20°C. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method to isolate replication intermediates for 2D gels. The immunoprecipitation of BrdU-containing chromatin was done as described80 with some modifications. DNA was sonicated to an average DNA fragment around 300 bp in length and denatured. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G, Invitrogen) were prepared by washing and resuspending 10 μL of Dynabeads in 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA and 0.1% Tween 20. Specific anti-BrdU antibodies were attached to the magnetic beads. For DNA immunoprecipitation, magnetic antibody-beads were added to denatured DNA (100°C for 10 min and rapidly chilled on ice) samples followed by incubation at 4°C, overnight. One eightieth of the solution was kept to process the INPUT fraction. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed twice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.,5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1X COMPLETE w/o EDTA antiproteolytic cocktail), twice in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, twice in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and once in TE 1X pH 8.0. Chromatin was then eluted from the magnetic beads in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). INPUT and IP samples were treated with 0.5 mg/mL proteinase K and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed by DNA purification with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and glycogen, and INPUT and IP DNA was resuspended in 10 μL of distilled sterile water.Rfa1-9xPK ChIP was performed as described.112 Briefly, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed with cold TBS and disrupted with glass beads. Magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein G, Invitrogen) were prepared by washing and resuspending 15 μL of Dynabeads in 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA. Specific anti-V5-tag antibodies were attached to the magnetic beads by incubation at 4°C, overnight. Chromatin was sonicated to an average DNA fragment size around 300 bp in length. One ninetieth of the solution was kept to process the INPUT fraction. For chromatin immunoprecipitation, magnetic antibody-beads were washed with 1 mL PBS, 5 mg/mL BSA, and added to sonicated DNA samples followed by incubation at 4°C, overnight. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed twice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.,5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1X COMPLETE w/o EDTA antiproteolytic cocktail), twice in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, twice in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and once in TE 1X pH 8.0. Protein-DNA was eluted from the magnetic beads in elution buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10mM EDTA, 1% SDS). ChIP and INPUT samples was incubated at 65°C overnight to reverse DNA-protein crosslink, and then were treated with proteinase K, purified with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. DNA pellets were resuspended in 1X TE with 0.3 mg/mL RNase A and purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Real time PCR was performed following a standard protocol. 4–8 ng of IPed or INPUT DNA from biological triplicates were amplified using FastStart Essential DNA Green Master (Roche) and a LightCycler96 machine (Roche). The PCR program (50 cycles of 95°C 10 s, 60°C 30 s, 72°C 30 s) was designed to amplify regions close to replication origins in chromosomes V and III using the following primer pairs (listed in Table S3): SPF1, 5′ ARS508 pair 2 - 3′ ARS508 pair 2; MAK10, 5′ ARS507 pair 2 - 3′ ARS507 pair 2; ARS503, 5′ ARS503-504 pair 2 - 3′ ARS503-504 pair 2; FUS1, 5′ ARS306 pair 1 - 3′ ARS306 pair 1; ARS305, 305 Fw - 305 Rev; CHA1, 5′ ARS302-320 pair 1 - 3′ ARS302-320 pair 1; ARS300, 5′ ARS300 pair 1 - 3′ ARS300 pair 1; ARS306, ARS306 Fwd - ARS306 Rev; ARS507, 5′ ARS507 pair 1 - 3′ ARS507 pair 1; ARS508, 5′ ARS508 pair 2 - 3′ ARS508 pair 2. Values resulting from amplification were used to calculate the fold increase of protein-associated nascent DNA (amount of IPed DNA in respect to INPUT DNA). Mean cycle threshold (Ct) values from triplicate qPCR reactions were used to calculate the fold increase using the formula 2e(Ct IP - Ct INPUT)/90.113 Data was represented as % of IP DNA in respect to INPUT data. The non-replicated region ARS300 was used to normalize the chipped Rfa1-9xPK signal at replicated regions (ARS306, ARS507, ARS305, and ARS508).
