Abstract

Nuclear receptors control the function of cells by regulating transcription from specific gene networks. The establishment and maintenance of epigenetic gene marks is fundamental to the regulation of gene transcription and the control of cell function. RIP140 is a corepressor for nuclear receptors that suppresses transcription from a broad programme of metabolic genes and thereby controls energy homoeostasis in vivo . Here we show by analysis of Ucp1 , a gene which is typically expressed in brown but not white adipocytes, that RIP140 is essential for both DNA and histone methylation to maintain gene repression. RIP140 expression promotes the assembly of DNA and histone methyltransferases (HMTs) on the Ucp1 enhancer and leads to methylation of specific CpG residues and histones as judged by bisulphite genomic sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our results suggest that RIP140 serves as a scaffold for both DNA and HMT activities to inhibit gene transcription by two key epigenetic repression systems.

Introduction

Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate a vast array of biological processes by modulating expression of specific target genes ( Yamamoto, 1985 ; McKenna and O'Malley, 2002a ). Their ability to stimulate transcription depends on the recruitment of cofactors that remodel chromatin and the assembly of the basal transcription machinery ( Dilworth and Chambon, 2001 ; Rosenfeld et al , 2006 ). Chromatin remodelling is achieved by enzymes that catalyse post-translational modifications of histones and the shuttling of nucleosomes by ATP-dependent mechanisms. The histone modifications, which include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, deimination, ADP ribosylation and proline isomerization, lead to alterations in the accessibility of chromatin and allow for regulated transcription of genes ( Kouzarides, 2007 ). These modifications which may take place sequentially or in combination are proposed to constitute a ‘histone code' ( Strahl and Allis, 2000 ; Turner, 2000 ; Jenuwein and Allis, 2001 ) that dictates the transcription state of genes. In addition to histone modifications, DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing ( Bird and Wolffe, 1999 ). Methylation at cytosine residues of the dinucleotide sequence CpG is essential for animal development ( Bird, 2002 ) and irregular methylation patterns lead to cancer ( Yoo and Jones, 2006 ).

The diverse biological processes regulated by nuclear receptors are attributed to differential recruitment of coactivators and corepressors that function as scaffolds for the recruitment of chromatin remodelling enzymes. In the absence of ligand, certain nuclear receptors recruit corepressors such as SMRT and N-CoR that bind repressive enzymes such as histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) ( Jepsen and Rosenfeld, 2002 ) or the histone methyltransferase (HMT) SUV39H1, which specifically methylates histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) ( Li et al , 2002 ). In the presence of a ligand, activated receptors recruit coactivators such as the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), HMTs, p160s and CBP/p300 as well as the arginine-specific HMTs PRMT1 and CARM1 to promote gene transcription ( Bauer et al , 2002 ; McKenna and O'Malley, 2002b ; Stallcup et al , 2003 ). On the other hand, ligand bound nuclear receptors can also bind corepressors such as RIP140 ( Cavailles et al , 1995 ) and L-CoR ( Fernandes et al , 2003 ) to actively repress gene expression.

RIP140 is highly conserved in vertebrates and widely expressed in tissues. Analysis of mice devoid of the RIP140 gene indicates that the corepressor is essential for ovulation ( White et al , 2000 ) and energy homoeostasis ( Leonardsson et al , 2004 ). Thus, RIP140-null mice accumulate markedly less fat in their adipose tissue, are resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity and exhibit improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity ( Leonardsson et al , 2004 ; Christian et al , 2006 ; Powelka et al , 2006 ). These changes are associated with increased expression of metabolic genes in white adipose tissue (WAT) ( Leonardsson et al , 2004 ) and muscle ( Seth et al , 2007 ). Among the upregulated genes is uncoupling protein 1 ( Ucp1 ) which is expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) during adaptive thermogenesis but normally remains silenced in WAT. Further analysis of adipocyte cell lines indicates that RIP140 plays an intrinsic role in suppressing transcription from gene networks responsible for catabolism ( Christian et al , 2005 ; Powelka et al , 2006 ). The Ucp1 gene is stimulated by a number of nuclear receptors that bind to an enhancer region 2.3 kb upstream of the start site of transcription ( Kozak et al , 1994 ; Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000 ). We have shown previously that RIP140 is capable of binding to this enhancer and that this is necessary and sufficient to reduce Ucp1 gene expression ( Christian et al , 2005 ).

RIP140 comprises four distinct repression domains ( Christian et al , 2004 ) that have been shown to bind HDACs ( Wei et al , 2000 ) and carboxy-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) ( Vo et al , 2001 ). CtBP has been shown to form a multisubunit protein complex that contains a number of chromatin-modifying enzymes including HDACs, and the HMTs, G9a and EuHMT ( Shi et al , 2003 ). To investigate the mechanism by which RIP140 inhibits transcription, we have focused on the Ucp1 gene and analysed the ability of the corepressor to modify epigenetic marks around its promoter and upstream enhancer. We made use of adipocytes with and without RIP140 ( Christian et al , 2005 ) and investigated whether the corepressor was required to modify histone residues and whether it was involved in DNA methylation. By using in vitro DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) assays as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, we show that the corepressor controls both DNA and histone methylation of the Ucp1 enhancer and promoter. Thus, RIP140 serves a role in controlling gene transcription by two key epigenetic repression systems.

RIP140 expression results in histone deacetylation and methylation of the Ucp1 enhancer and promoter

We next focused on the Ucp1 gene to investigate the influence of RIP140 on the epigenetic state of the promoter, the enhancer and an upstream control region ( Figure 3A ). We analysed epigenetic marks characteristic of transcriptional activation and repression in RIP140-null adipocytes that express Ucp1 and RIP140-expressing adipocytes in which the Ucp1 gene is suppressed ( Christian et al , 2005 ). Histone modifications were analysed by ChIP assays ( Figure 3B and C ). General acetylation of H3 and H4 was decreased in RIP140-expressing adipocytes compared with RIP140-null cells at both the enhancer and promoter of Ucp1 consistent with reduced expression of the gene, while there were no significant differences in the chromatin state of the upstream control region. Similarly, there was a reduction in the presence of RIP140, of di-methylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2), a mark usually associated with active genes ( Santos-Rosa et al , 2002 ). The most striking differences, however, were enrichments in methylation of histone H3 at lysines 9 (H3K9) and 27 (H3K27), marks characteristic of repressed gene promoters ( Lachner et al , 2003 ). In particular, H3K9me2 involved in transcriptional repression in euchromatic regions and H3K9me3, which is usually associated with heterochromatin ( Peters et al , 2003 ; Rice et al , 2003 ), were increased in RIP140-expressing adipocytes at both the enhancer and promoter. Similarly, there was a marked increase in H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 involved in Polycomb group (PcG) silencing ( Cao et al , 2002 ; Kuzmichev et al , 2002 ) at both the enhancer and promoter but not at the upstream control region. We conclude that RIP140 expression in adipocytes results in an enrichment of repressive histone modifications, leading to a reduction of Ucp1 gene expression.

RIP140 expression results in DNA methylation of the Ucp1 enhancer and promoter

Since RIP140 is associated with Dnmt activity, we investigated the state of DNA methylation at the Ucp1 promoter and enhancer. There are 34 CpG dinucleotides at the Ucp1 proximal promoter region spanning −600 to +200 bp and two in the 200 bp enhancer region. Using bisulphite genomic sequencing, we determined the methylation levels of these CpGs in RIP140-null adipocytes, adipocytes expressing exogenous RIP140 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes ( Figure 4A ). In adipocytes devoid of RIP140, both CpGs in the Ucp1 enhancer were completely unmethylated, whereas RIP140 expression leads to 72–80% methylation. RIP140 expression also leads to an increase in DNA methylation in the proximal promoter region in the immediate vicinity of the transcriptional start site (−150 to +79 bp). To quantify the level of methylation at a specific CpG dinucleotide (indicated by line in Figure 4A ), we digested bisulphite-treated genomic DNA from the three cell lines with the restriction endonuclease TaqI , which only digests methylated DNA ( Figure 4B ). This confirmed that in the absence of RIP140 this CpG remains unmethylated, whereas RIP140 expression leads to approximately 40% DNA methylation at this site.

Discussion

Previous work has clearly established the importance of RIP140 as a corepressor for nuclear receptors and its role in inhibiting metabolic gene expression ( Leonardsson et al , 2004 ; Christian et al , 2005 ; Powelka et al , 2006 ; Debevec et al , 2007 ; Seth et al , 2007 ). In this study, we demonstrate that RIP140 targets repressive histone-modifying and DNA methylation activity to the Ucp1 enhancer to silence gene expression. RIP140 expression in RIP140-null adipocytes leads to an increase in methylation of histone tails at H3-K9 and H3-K27 and CpG dinucleotides in the enhancer/promoter of this gene. Thus it appears that RIP140 provides a scaffold for the assembly of both histone and DNA-modifying enzymes, thereby providing a mechanistic link between two key epigenetic repression systems to regulate Ucp1 gene expression in adipocytes.

Ucp1 is expressed in BAT during adaptive thermogenesis ( Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000 ), but normally remains silenced in WAT. We have recently demonstrated that the nuclear receptors PPARα, PPARγ and ERRα are responsible for the upregulated Ucp1 expression observed in RIP140-null adipocytes by binding to an upstream enhancer element ( Debevec et al , 2007 ). RIP140 is also recruited to this enhancer which is both necessary and sufficient to mediate repression of the Ucp1 gene in adipocytes ( Christian et al , 2005 ; Debevec et al , 2007 ). Characterization of autonomous repression domains (RDs) within RIP140 indicate that they function by HDAC-dependent and -independent mechanisms ( Christian et al , 2004 ). RD1 has been shown to bind HDACs 1 and 3 ( Wei et al , 2000 ) and we have shown here that it may also function by recruiting Dnmts. RD2 binds directly to CtBP ( Vo et al , 2001 ; Christian et al , 2004 ), which forms a multiprotein repressive complex with HDACs and HMTs ( Shi et al , 2003 ). RD3 together with RD4 also seem to recruit DNA methylation activity to the corepressor. Thus, it appears that RIP140 facilitates the binding of a host of repressive enzymes including HDAC1, HDAC3, CtBP, G9, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a/3b to the Ucp1 enhancer leading to modification of histones and DNA to prevent gene transcription. It is conceivable that the binding of these enzymes is an indirect consequence of other repressive mechanisms, but we favour a central role for RIP140 for the following reasons: repression of Ucp1 expression is entirely dependent on RIP140, while the upstream enhancer which binds RIP140 is necessary and sufficient to mediate the repression ( Christian et al , 2005 ); the recruitment of repressive enzymes to the enhancer occurs only following RIP140 expression; RIP140 interacts directly with HDACs, CtBP and Dnmts; Re-ChIP experiments demonstrate the simultaneous presence of RIP140, CtBP and Dnmts at the Ucp1 enhancer and importantly RIP140 purifies DNA methylation activity to methylate DNA templates in vitro . It is noteworthy that Dnmts have been shown to be targeted to promoters via their association with sequence-specific binding proteins such as Rb, E2F1 and RP58 ( Robertson et al , 2000 ; Fuks et al , 2001 ). We propose that RIP140 functions in a similar manner to target the Dnmts, HDACs, CtBP and G9a to the Ucp1 enhancer element to induce silencing of the gene.

DNA methylation, histone deacetylation, H3K9 and H3K27 methylation typically coincide in heterochromatin and silent gene promoters ( Bird, 2001 ; Fuks, 2005 ). The deposition of H3K9 methylation by G9a at the Ucp1 enhancer may lead to repression via a number of mechanisms. Both di- and tri-H3K9-methylated peptides form binding sites for HP1 that associates with other repressors including HDACs and RNAs that silence gene expression. This mechanism has been shown to be important in both heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression ( Nielsen et al , 2001 ; Kouzarides, 2002 ). However, H3K9 methylation and HP1 do not completely colocalize and H3K9me is also sufficient to suppress transcription independent of HP1, through mechanisms involving histone deacetylation ( Stewart et al , 2005 ) and by inhibiting phosphorylation of H3S10 ( Cheung et al , 2000 ).

H3K27 methylation is catalysed by the enzymatic activity of the PcG protein EZH2 ( Cao et al , 2002 ; Kuzmichev et al , 2002 ). This subsequently leads to repression by facilitating the binding of additional PRC2 and PRC1 repressive PcG multiprotein complexes. Interestingly, Bracken et al (2006) have recently identified Ucp1 as a PcG target gene in human embryonic fibroblasts. In their study, the Ucp1 promoter showed strong enrichments for the PcG proteins SUZ12, CBX8 and H3K27me3, while depletion of EZH2 resulted in a significant upregulation of Ucp1 expression. Therefore, the RIP140-dependent induction of H3K27 trimethylation at the Ucp1 enhancer and promoter may be mediated by the enzymatic activity of EZH2. EZH2 has been shown to interact directly with Dnmts and is necessary but not sufficient for de novo DNA methylation of PcG-repressed genes ( Vire et al , 2006 ). Moreover, although EZH2-mediated H3K27 methylation pre-marks genes for silencing in cancer, additional factors are required to promote de novo DNA methylation ( Schlesinger et al , 2007 ). Our finding that the recruitment of Dnmts for the repression of Ucp1 is dependent on RIP140, and that H3K27me3 is increased by RIP140 expression suggests that the corepressor may function as a trigger for EZH2 activation.

We have demonstrated that the RIP140-mediated recruitment of Dnmts leads to a striking increase in DNA methylation at the enhancer and proximal promoter. One mechanism by which DNA methylation is proposed to repress gene expression involves interference with the binding of transcription factors ( Bird and Wolffe, 1999 ). At least two CpG dinucleotides methylated in RIP140-expressing adipocytes overlap functional binding sites for the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor implicated in Ucp1 regulation ( Rim and Kozak, 2002 ). In particular, cAMP response elements CRE2 and CRE4 (indicated by arrows in Figure 4 ) bind phosphorylated CREB. A recent genome-wide analysis of CREB promoter occupancy has clearly demonstrated that DNA methylation of CREB response elements is inhibitory to the binding of this transcription factor ( Zhang et al , 2005 ). Our results support the notion that RIP140 might suppress Ucp1 expression by methylation of CREs. It is noteworthy that the methylation levels of these CpGs are significantly higher in WAT than in BAT of wild-type mice, while this difference is less prominent in RIP140-null mice in which there is Ucp1 expression in WAT (data not shown).

Adipose genes that are subject to repression by RIP140 fall into two groups. One group comprises genes such as Ucp1 that are generally inactive in WAT but can be derepressed in the absence of RIP140. The ability of RIP140 to direct repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation provides a mechanism for silencing Ucp1 and similar genes in WAT that are normally only expressed in BAT. It appears therefore that RIP140 plays a developmental role by epigenetically silencing a subset of genes during adipogenesis that are involved in energy expenditure in brown adipocytes and thereby ensuring that they are not expressed in white adipocytes. On the other hand, the majority of genes repressed by RIP140 are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and expressed in both brown and white adipocytes. The mechanism by which RIP140 regulates the expression of this second group of target genes remains to be determined.

Taken together, this study highlights a novel role for RIP140 in directing key epigenetic repression mechanisms, namely H3K9, H3K27 and DNA methylation for silencing of a PcG pre-marked gene. These findings provide a mechanistic link between a hormonally regulated nuclear receptor corepressor and essential epigenetic mechanisms. These results also provide an insight into the mechanism of tissue-specific regulation of Ucp1 and underlie a developmental role for RIP140 in determining the metabolic profile and function of adipose tissue by epigenetically marking relevant genes or gene networks.
