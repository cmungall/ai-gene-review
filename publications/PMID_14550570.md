Germ-line mutations in BRCA1 are associated with an increased lifetime risk of 
developing breast and/or ovarian tumors. The BRCA1 gene product is a 220-kDa 
protein that contains a tandem of two BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains required 
for transcription. In an attempt to understand how BRCA1 exerts its function 
through BRCT domains, we search for partners of the BRCT domains of BRCA1. Using 
the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the four and a half LIM-only protein 
2 (FHL2) as a novel BRCA1 interacting protein. We demonstrate that BRCA1 and 
FHL2 can physically associate in vitro, in yeast, and in human cells. BRCA1 
interacted with FHL2 through its second BRCT domain and the interaction of FHL2 
with BRCA1 requires the last three LIM domains of FHL2. BRCA1 enhanced 
FHL2-mediated transcriptional activity in transient transfections. Tumor-derived 
transactivation-deficient BRCA1 mutants showed a reduced ability to enhance 
transactivation by FHL2. Lack of BRCA1 binding sites in the FHL2 completely 
abolished the FHL2 transactivation function. Reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction analysis showed that FHL2 mRNA levels may be downregulated in 
many breast cancer cell lines. These results suggest that the BRCA1-FHL2 
interaction may be involved in transcriptional regulation and play a significant 
role in cancer cell growth.
