PURPOSE: To study the role of p53 and bcl-2 in the response of the small 
intestine to irradiation delivered at low dose-rate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice homozygous for p53 or bcl-2 deletion (-/-), their 
respective heterozygotes (+/-), and their wild-type littermates (+/+) including 
a previously used hybrid strain (B6D2F1), were irradiated to the whole-body 
using 60Co gamma-rays at 1 Gy h(-1). Crypt survival levels in the small 
intestine were measured at day 3 after the end of irradiation.
RESULTS: Crypt survival levels were higher in p53 -/- mice than in the other p53 
genotypes after 25-30 Gy, but not after lower or higher doses. Similar 
experiments with the three genotypes for bcl-2 status showed lower crypt 
survival after all doses used in the -/- mice, compared with the +/- and +/+ 
mice, which were similar in response. The marked degree of curvature in the 
survival curve observed for the p53 genotypes was also observed in B6D2F1 hybrid 
mice, was particularly striking in the p53 -/- mice, but was not seen to the 
same extent in the bcl-2 genotypes. The heterozygotes for p53 or for bcl-2 were 
nearer in response to their respective +/+ genotypes rather than the -/- 
genotypes.
CONCLUSION: The increased crypt survival levels at some radiation dose levels in 
the p53 nulls contrasts with the lack of change reported previously using 
irradiation at high dose-rate. The decreased survival in the bcl-2 nulls is 
consistent with the known 'survival' function of bcl-2, although bcl-2 
expression has not been detected immunohistochemically in this intestinal site. 
The marked degree of curvature in the dose-response curve at high dose levels 
for some genotypes was unexpected at this low dose-rate.

INTRODUCTIONThe Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011 forced much attention to the health effects of exposure to radiation at low dose and low dose-rate. Although it has not been assessed scientifically, from radiation protection point of view, the linear non-threshold (LNT) model has been applied to estimate the cancer risk, which led to multiple layers of unpleasant emotion that makes social problems hindering resilience and recovery of the affected areas [1].Considering the estimation of cancer risk obtained from the epidemiological studies of atomic-bomb survivors [2, 3], the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has applied a reduction value, called the dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF), of 2 [4]. The concept relies on the idea that the dose-rate effect is related to the dose response, which is sublinear in the low dose range. Extrapolation of radiation risks estimated at high doses and high dose-rates to low doses and low dose-rates was used to deliver DDREF value. Inevitably, the DDREF value has been debated by various international organizations, and by the scientists with respect to diverse aspects of emerging novel radiobiological knowledge [5, 6].Recent studies with animal models have made significant contributions to provide quantitative data and mechanistic insights [7–9]. The application of animal data to human populations remains in debate, but, the information, including the biological mechanisms, is apparently the clue to understand the dose-rate effects of ionizing radiation comprehensively [10, 11]. Thus, the aim of the current review is to compile the animal studies, mostly rodent studies, with respect to the dose-rate-dependent adverse effects. Since intensive discussions have already been carried out elsewhere on the use of animal studies in estimation of the dose-rate effectiveness factor (DREF) [9], the review especially focuses on results with regard to the underlying biological mechanisms of the dose-rate-dependent adverse effects and discussed their possible involvement in the key events related to carcinogenesis.Recently, utilizing the concept of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP), together with that of the ‘key events’ leading to an outcome as a clue to the better estimation of radiation risks at low doses and low dose-rates has been discussed [5, 12]. The AOP/key events approach was originally adopted for assessing the risks associated with environmental chemicals [13]. The usage of AOPs has enabled the biology-based estimation of risks from exposure to environmental chemicals, so that the same approach could be useful for radiobiological studies into epidemiology of human populations. In particular, as a systematic representation of current knowledge, the AOP concept is expected to facilitate evaluation of the biological basis of causation from the initial physical events to the cellular and tissue/organ events, and to the individual and population levels [14, 15]. While there are literatures considering the significance of key events in AOP with respect to the dose-rate effects [16, 17], little information is available for animal models. Therefore, we scrutinize the dose-rate dependency of novel key events (Table 1), which should enable unification of the underlying critical mechanisms to connect animal experimental studies with human epidemiological studies.Table 1AOP and key events1.

INTRODUCTION

The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident in 2011 forced much attention to the health effects of exposure to radiation at low dose and low dose-rate. Although it has not been assessed scientifically, from radiation protection point of view, the linear non-threshold (LNT) model has been applied to estimate the cancer risk, which led to multiple layers of unpleasant emotion that makes social problems hindering resilience and recovery of the affected areas [1].

Considering the estimation of cancer risk obtained from the epidemiological studies of atomic-bomb survivors [2, 3], the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has applied a reduction value, called the dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF), of 2 [4]. The concept relies on the idea that the dose-rate effect is related to the dose response, which is sublinear in the low dose range. Extrapolation of radiation risks estimated at high doses and high dose-rates to low doses and low dose-rates was used to deliver DDREF value. Inevitably, the DDREF value has been debated by various international organizations, and by the scientists with respect to diverse aspects of emerging novel radiobiological knowledge [5, 6].

Recent studies with animal models have made significant contributions to provide quantitative data and mechanistic insights [7–9]. The application of animal data to human populations remains in debate, but, the information, including the biological mechanisms, is apparently the clue to understand the dose-rate effects of ionizing radiation comprehensively [10, 11]. Thus, the aim of the current review is to compile the animal studies, mostly rodent studies, with respect to the dose-rate-dependent adverse effects. Since intensive discussions have already been carried out elsewhere on the use of animal studies in estimation of the dose-rate effectiveness factor (DREF) [9], the review especially focuses on results with regard to the underlying biological mechanisms of the dose-rate-dependent adverse effects and discussed their possible involvement in the key events related to carcinogenesis.

Recently, utilizing the concept of the adverse outcome pathway (AOP), together with that of the ‘key events’ leading to an outcome as a clue to the better estimation of radiation risks at low doses and low dose-rates has been discussed [5, 12]. The AOP/key events approach was originally adopted for assessing the risks associated with environmental chemicals [13]. The usage of AOPs has enabled the biology-based estimation of risks from exposure to environmental chemicals, so that the same approach could be useful for radiobiological studies into epidemiology of human populations. In particular, as a systematic representation of current knowledge, the AOP concept is expected to facilitate evaluation of the biological basis of causation from the initial physical events to the cellular and tissue/organ events, and to the individual and population levels [14, 15]. While there are literatures considering the significance of key events in AOP with respect to the dose-rate effects [16, 17], little information is available for animal models. Therefore, we scrutinize the dose-rate dependency of novel key events (Table 1), which should enable unification of the underlying critical mechanisms to connect animal experimental studies with human epidemiological studies.

AOP and key events

We selected five tissues/organs, namely the mammary gland, digestive tract, hematopoietic tissue, lung and liver, based upon the higher tissue weighting factor and the amount of available data for the dose-rate effect. The definition of low-dose and low-dose-rate herein follows the consideration by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). An ionizing radiation dose of <100 mGy is considered as being low dose, and a dose rate of <0.1 mGy/min averaged over 1 h (corresponding to 6 mGy/h) is regarded as low-dose-rate [18].

Typical dose and dose rates used in studies for radiation risk inference by ICRP were recently overviewed by ICRP Task Group 91 [7]. A wide dose-rate range of radiation, from 0.0046 mSv/min of annual effective dose for world population to 7 × 104 Gy/sec of kerma free-in-air for prompt primary gamma radiation at 1000 m from the hypocenter in Hiroshima (assuming a spread in time of the gamma pulse at the ground of 1 ms), was covered. On the other hand, the animal studies considered in this review covered a relatively narrow dose-rate range, which differs from the doses and dose rates considered in the human population studies.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ANIMAL STUDIESWithout doubt, epidemiology is the most important source of information for radiation protection purposes. The greatest advantage of epidemiology is that it examines the human itself, whereas unignorable disadvantages include limitations in the study resulting in various kinds of uncertainties [19–21]. For example, uncertainties in dose and dose-rate, duration and timing limit accurate dose reconstruction. Adverse outcomes are often not directly evaluated, so that failure to ascertain all diseases reduces power, leading to an underestimation of any effect. Furthermore, the possibility of bias could not be excluded, as all possible confounding factors are unable to be considered. In comparison, animal experiments afford greater freedom of design, albeit with the disadvantage that the data acquired are for non-humans. Thus, epidemiology and animal experiments need to be mutually complemented. As listed in Table 2, there are various differences between epidemiology and animal experiments, and these differences must be considered when attempting to make inferences about humans from data of animal studies.Table 2Typical differences between epidemiology and animal studies on radiation effectsItemEpidemiologyAnimal studyTargetHumanNon-humanStudy designMany limitationsFreePopulation sizeHundreds to millionsSeveral to thousandsObservation periodYears to decadesMonths to yearsIdentification of diseaseIndirect (use of medical and other public registries)Direct observationPopulation homogeneity (genetics, lifestyle, environment, etc.)HeterogeneousHomogeneousDose/dose rateRetrospectively estimatedPlannedAge at exposureRelatively unbiasedOften biased toward young agesAttained ageAnalyzedRarely analyzed (due to small sample size)Effect measuresRelative risk, absolute risk, etc.Percentage of animals with disease, number of tumors, lifespan, etc.Statistical analysisRegression analysis using statistical modelsSimple comparisons among groups (in general)Possibility of confoundingVery high due to life-style factors such as smoking, alcohol consumptionRelatively small because experimental animals are comparatively uniformBoth epidemiological and animal studies have contributed to the scientific understanding of how dose rate affects health effects of radiation, especially cancer risk. Relevant epidemiological studies include those on nuclear workers (INWORKS [22, 23], Mayak [24] and Million Person Study (MPS) cohorts [25]), environmental exposures (Techa, Chernobyl, High Background Radiation Areas and radioactive fallouts) [20] and medical radiations (tuberculosis, computed tomography scans, etc.) [26]. Nevertheless, the uncertainties inherent to these studies hinder conclusion on whether the cancer risk at low dose rate is smaller than that inferred from studies of acute exposure, such as to atomic-bomb radiation [20]. On the other hand, a large number of experimental studies were reported in the past century and identified generally reduced cancer development in animals exposed at low dose rate as compared with those at high dose rate [8, 27, 28]. More recent efforts have integrated and re-analyzed archived data of such studies [29–31]. In this regard, it would also be meaningful to integrate recent large low-dose-rate exposure experiments conducted at the Institute of Environmental Sciences [32] with comparable high dose rate experiments. Results of animal experiments on specific tissues will be summarized in the following section.Animal experiments require extrapolation to human, as extensively discussed previously [33]. Comparative studies have shown astonishing concordance among mice, beagle dogs and humans in the dose-dependence of the survival curves [34–36]. Integration of biological and epidemiological findings has been accordingly attempted by BEIR VII (2006) for risk estimation in humans [25]. Furthermore, recent discussions have proposed the idea of integrating epidemiology and biology using the concept of AOP [19] and a ‘parallelogram’ approach [37] (Fig. 1). Animal experiments are thus considered to be a rich source of information in order to make inferences about radiation effects in humans. Nonetheless, care should be always taken with respect to biological differences between human and experimental animals. For example, frequent tumors in mice often include thymic lymphoma, histiocystic sarcoma and tumors of the pituitary, ovary and Harderian gland, whereas human organs most relevant to radiation protection are the stomach, lung, colon, female breast and bone marrow, followed by liver, bladder, esophagus and thyroid. Ovarian tumors and thymic lymphomas show prominent dose-rate effects, although the indirect mechanisms for the induction of these tumors, which are irrelevant to human, impede extrapolation to humans [19]. Aging is also species dependent; some attempts have been made to compare human and animal ages in terms of their systemic physiology [38, 39], although more elaborate comparisons should be made for each tissue, like what is done on brain development [40]. Understanding the species difference in physiology and pathogenesis of individual organs is thus crucial for consideration of the applicability of findings from animal studies to human.Fig. 1Parallelogram approach to the integration of epidemiology and animal experiments.

Thus, epidemiology and animal experiments need to be mutually complemented. As listed in Table 2, there are various differences between epidemiology and animal experiments, and these differences must be considered when attempting to make inferences about humans from data of animal studies.

Typical differences between epidemiology and animal studies on radiation effects

Both epidemiological and animal studies have contributed to the scientific understanding of how dose rate affects health effects of radiation, especially cancer risk. Relevant epidemiological studies include those on nuclear workers (INWORKS [22, 23], Mayak [24] and Million Person Study (MPS) cohorts [25]), environmental exposures (Techa, Chernobyl, High Background Radiation Areas and radioactive fallouts) [20] and medical radiations (tuberculosis, computed tomography scans, etc.) [26]. Nevertheless, the uncertainties inherent to these studies hinder conclusion on whether the cancer risk at low dose rate is smaller than that inferred from studies of acute exposure, such as to atomic-bomb radiation [20]. On the other hand, a large number of experimental studies were reported in the past century and identified generally reduced cancer development in animals exposed at low dose rate as compared with those at high dose rate [8, 27, 28]. More recent efforts have integrated and re-analyzed archived data of such studies [29–31]. In this regard, it would also be meaningful to integrate recent large low-dose-rate exposure experiments conducted at the Institute of Environmental Sciences [32] with comparable high dose rate experiments. Results of animal experiments on specific tissues will be summarized in the following section.

STUDIES TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DOSE-RATE EFFECTSTo gain mechanistic insights into dose-rate effects it is critical to overview both in vitro and in vivo studies with respect to the fundamental mechanisms. Thus, this section specifically extracts in vitro experiments towards the initial critical key events, i.e. induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and mutations, and attempts to rephrase the interpretation of the results.Summary of in vitro studiesInduction of DSBs in cells at low doseSeveral previous studies that have investigated dose-rate effects on DSB induction, all of which showed linear dose-dependent induction of DSBs at high doses and high-dose-rates. Although it was rather difficult to quantify the number of DSBs induced by low-dose radiation exposure at a low-dose-rate, it is now possible through the application of surrogate markers for DSBs. This is because such DSB markers are sensitive enough to detect even a single DSB within a cell [41]. Among surrogate DSB markers the foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX at serine 139, called γ-H2AX foci, appear to be the earliest one and used widely in such studies [42]. Since ATM-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX expands over several megabases of chromatin [43], phosphorylation is detectable as discrete dots, which are called foci, under a microscope [41], by using a specific monoclonal antibody [44, 45]. There are other DNA damage repair and response factors, which can serve as the markers for DSBs as well [46, 47].The linear dose–response of γ-H2AX foci was evident between 1.2 mGy and 2 Gy delivered at a high-dose-rate in normal human cells [48], which was confirmed by others [46, 49]. It was claimed that DSBs induced by very low doses were more repairable than those induced by higher doses [48]. For example, the excess amount of DSBs induced by 5 mGy or 20 mGy of X-rays was found to decrease significantly within 24 h after X-irradiation. Similar efficient repair of DSBs caused by low-dose γ-rays was reported elsewhere [49].DSBs induced at a low-dose-rate radiationTo investigate continuous low-dose radiation exposure, unique radiation exposure facilities have been established [50]. For example, the effects of high- (1.8 Gy/min) and low- (0.3 mGy/min) dose-rate radiation exposure were compared [51]. Whereas exposure to high-dose-rate radiation led to a linear increase in γ-H2AX foci, the same total dose, delivered at low-dose-rate, showed a very small increase within the first 2 days. Another study indicated that, during the 4-days irradiation, the accumulation of foci was observed from day 2 to 4 only by exposure at 0.694 mGy/min not at 0.007, 0.069 and 0.347 mGy/min [52], indicating the balance between the induction of DSBs and their repair is crucial.As discussed previously, a single DSB has little ability to cause large-scale genome rearrangement, which is one of the critical events leading to cancer [53]. Therefore, even with the same total dose, dose delivered at high-dose-rate can induce multiple DSBs simultaneously in the same cell. In contrast, the same dose but delivered at low-dose-rate can result in spatially and temporally isolated DSBs in different cells, indicating the DREF value should be more than 1. It is well documented that DSBs caused by low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation are efficiently repaired, although it is also claimed that even a single DSB may be accompanied by a cluster of DNA damage including single-strand breaks and base damage [54]. Furthermore, the possibility that a single radiation track causes two or more DSBs in close proximity has been raised. Such possibility still remains to be explored [55].Detection of DNA double strand breaks in vivoApplications of foci of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 have also been attempted in animal studies [56–59]. It was found that 10 mGy of X-rays delivered at 2 Gy/min increased 53BP1 foci as well as γ-H2AX foci in the heart, small intestine and kidney [56]. The reduction in the excess foci indicated that the induced DSBs were reparable when mice were exposed to 100 mGy, while those induced by 10 mGy decreased slightly but not completely even after 72 h of irradiation [58]. Therefore, 10 mGy daily irradiation repeated up to 50 times did not change the focus levels in enterocytes, but resulted in the accumulation of foci in cortical neurons, skin keratinocytes and hair follicles. Thus, even at low dose, DSBs accumulated in tissues, when radiation was delivered at 2 Gy/min.Accumulation of DSBs by continuous irradiation at a very low-dose-rate was examined by using mice in cages were kept on the flood phantom filled with 125I-containing buffer [60]. The low-dose-rate was 0.0017 mGy/min (2.4 mGy/day), while high-dose-rate used was 71 mGy/min and the total dose was 105 mGy, Detectable increase in DNA damage was observed at 71 mGy/min but not at 0.0017 mGy/min [60].Foci formation was sometimes not apparent in tissues/organs. For example, the human skin basal layers showed focus, while the granular and cornified layers did not develop foci [47]. Similar results were obtained in lung, liver and intestine [58, 59]. Although limitations of sensitivity of detection systems using surrogate markers should be considered, the focus formation was undetectable in heterochromatinized nuclei in terminally differentiated cells [47]. For example, small intestinal crypt cells are highly efficient in inducing foci, which was gradually decreased in the villous regions (Fig. 2). These results clearly demonstrate that activation of DNA damage response, which results in the foci formation, is not executed in terminally differentiated cells. Thus, from the biological point of view, a certain fraction of cells in tissues/organs, such as terminally differentiated cells, could not be the cell origin of cancer. Under the low-dose-rate exposure situation, exposed cells may undergo differentiation before the total accumulated dose is delivered, providing one possible mechanism for dose-rate effects in vivo.Fig. 253BP1 foci in the mouse small intestine 6 h after 4.0 Gy of X-rays. Multiple foci were induced in the crypt region, while they were rarely detected in villi, indicating that, although DSBs should be induced in every cell, but the DNA damage response, i.e. accumulation of 53BP1, is dependent on differentiation status.Summary of knowledge acquired from animal models of cancer developmentLarge scale animal experiments have defined the dose- and dose-rate-dependency of cancer induction, and more recently, mechanistic insights at the molecular levels, such as DNA damage induction, DNA damage repair and DNA damage response, which are the closely related issues to radiation carcinogenesis, are discussed in detail with respect to genomic instability and mutagenesis [61]. Thus, this section reviews dose-rate effects in animal experiments concerning bone marrow, mammary gland, digestive tract, lung and liver and discusses the possible underlying mechanisms with respect to AOP.Mammary glandBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Epidemiological studies such as those on atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors have demonstrated that radiation exposure is its major risk factor, and increased risk related with radiation dose and the age at exposure [62]. 
Architecture, development and maintenance. The mammary gland is a tree of branching ducts, consisting of an outer layer of basal (myoepithelial) cells and inner layer of luminal cells (Fig. 3). Species differences does exist between rodents and humans in terms of architecture [63, 64]. In rodents, mammary ducts end in either terminal end buds ([TEB] sites of post-pubertal ductal elongation), terminal ducts and lobuloalveolus and the intra-lobular stroma is scanty (Fig. 3). In humans, mammary ducts end in the terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) with rich fibroblastic stroma. The human TDLU is a site at which breast cancer frequently develops and is considered as comparable to the lobuloalveolus and TEBs of rodents [63, 64]. In mice, the fetal gland consists of bipotent cells (i.e. capable of giving rise to basal and luminal lineages), which after birth turn into lineage-restricted basal and luminal progenitors that independently maintain the gland, with some controversial evidence has suggested the existence of long-term bipotent stem cells in adulthood [65]. In rodents, most of the mammary epithelial cells are produced during the post-pubertal development at TEB, which after maturation differentiate into either terminal ducts or lobuloalveolar buds in rodents [64]. Lobuloalveoli undergo extensive growth during pregnancy and lactation, and cessation of lactation induces their involution and remodeling in rodents, a change which is rather mild in human [65].Fig. 3Architecture of rodent mammary gland.Mammary epithelial cells undergo cyclic waves of proliferation and death in association with menstrual (~28 days, human) and estrous (4–5 days, mice and rats) cycles [66–68]. In both mice and rats, the progeny of proliferative cells, detected via intense labeling after a few weeks’ administration of bromodeoxyuridine, was found to steadily decrease with time and reach one tenth after ~2 months [69, 70], whereas in mice, basal and luminal progenitor cells continue to exist at least for 10 weeks [71, 72], indicating longer life of progenitor cells than differentiated cells. Life of mammary cells in human is not understood.As ovarian hormones direct development of mammary gland, they also play key roles in mammary carcinogenesis. Early menopause is associated with reduced breast cancer risk in women, and in both rodents and human, high radiation dose (over 2–5 Gy) to ovaries has been associated with early ovarian dysfunction and a reduction in radiation-associated breast cancer risk [73–75]. The effect on the ovary is lower at a low dose rate [76]. 
Dose-rate effect in radiation carcinogenesis. A series of experimental studies with rats and mice have been conducted. Data obtained from the comparison between the high dose-rate and low dose-rate exposure have provided rather conflicting results [77–88] (Table 3). It seems likely that dose-rate effects are affected by physiological factors. In fact, continuous administration of estrogen was reported to uncover dose-rate effects [83], consistent with the more recent finding that the dose-rate effect is more prominent in post-pubertal than peri-pubertal rats [76].Table 3Mammary carcinogenesis studies comparing the effects of acute and chronic exposuresI.FractionationSpecies (strain)RadiationEffect measureAcute exposure dose responseDose per fraction (interval time)Exposure periodTotal dose (Gy)Age when exposure startedEffect, fractionatedEffect, acute singleReferenceMouse (BALB/c)γ, 137Cs% with tumor (age-adjusted)Linear-quadratic10 mGy (1 d)50 mGy (1 d)25 d5 d0.2512 wk0.2%a9.7%12.3%[77]Rat (Sprague–‌Dawley)γ, 60CoIncrease in tumor no.Linear0.14–1.1 Gy (0.5 wk)2–16 wk4.46 wk3–6/103 MDb2–3/103 MD[78, 79]Rat (WAG/Rij)XTime to detectionNot analyzed0.2 Gy (1 mo)10 mo2.08 wk143 wkc139 wk[81]Rat (WAG/Rij)γ, 137CsExcess normalized riskLinear2.5–10 mGy (0.5 d)8–56 wk1 or 28 wk0.9–1.2/Gyd1.1/Gy[82, 84]Rat (WAG/Rij), estrogen-treatedγ, 137CsExcess normalized riskSigmoid2.5–40 mGy (0.5 d)2–56 wk1 or 28 wk0.6–2.4/Gyd7.7 at 1 Gye[83, 84]II.

Possible ‘key events’ related to the dose rate effect. As mentioned below, studies have analyzed tissue response of mammary gland to acute single irradiation at a high dose rate. Evidence on early key events in the AOP (Table 1) suggests induction of imbalance between basal and luminal cells as a result of their differential sensitivity to radiation [89], which may be more prominent at high acute doses, providing a possible basis for dose-rate effects. Regarding later key events, stimulation of long-term cell proliferation has been observed after acute radiation exposure, indicating hormonal and microenvironmental alterations. In fact, some microenvironmental changes show a switch-like dose response with a very low threshold, providing another mechanistic basis for the dose-rate effects. Early responses and later tissue kinetics after low dose-rate exposure, including the existence of radiation-induced cell competition [90], remain an open question. 
DNA damage responses. γH2AX foci are formed at 1 h, and mostly disappear by 4 h, after a single high-dose (2–6 Gy) irradiation in basal and luminal mammary cells of BALB/c mice, Sprague–Dawley rats and human tissue xenografts and the response is generally more prominent in luminal than basal cells [91–93], although these studies did not conclude whether this also holds true for TEBs and TDLU. γH2AX induction in luminal progenitor cells and mature cells is similar and dose dependent in rats [93]. Basal cells might have high non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity in BALB/c mice [92], although, controversially, they are prone to radiation-induced cell death as mentioned below. Focus formation of Rad51 was not detected in irradiated human mammary tissue xenograft, indicating a minor role for homologous recombination (HR) repair [91]. 
Intracellular signaling. Following the aforementioned initial responses to high dose radiation (2–5 Gy), Trp53 protein, which is a nuclear protein, is phosphorylated by nuclear kinases, such ATM and DNA-PK, in cells of the post-pubertal BALB/c mouse mammary ducts and human tissue xenografts after 1 h and is redistributed to cytoplasm in luminal cells at 4–6 h whereas it remains in the nucleus in basal cells [91, 94–96]. Trp53 may induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, the latter possibly being regulated in parallel by Brca2 [97]. 
Gene expression. Activation of Trp53 as mentioned above induces expression of Cdkn1a (p21) in BALB/c mouse mammary ducts and lobuloalveoli [96]. 
Cell cycle regulation. An acute high dose (2–5 Gy) irradiation drastically decreases incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in TEB of hybrid mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ strains and Sprague–Dawley rats by 6 h, indicating induction of S phase arrest [97, 98]. In BALB/c mice, most basal and luminal cells show reduced Ki67-positive fractions after acute 6 Gy irradiation, implying entrance to G0, while a subset of proliferative basal mammary cells exhibit G2 arrest [92]. In Sprague–Dawley rats, release from cell cycle arrest occurs in basal cells by 24 h, when luminal cells show longer arrest [93]. 
Cell death. An acute high dose (2–5 Gy) irradiation induces only moderate apoptosis in mammary glands of post-pubertal BALB/c mice, hybrid mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ strains and Sprague–Dawley rats [93–96]; this was Trp53-dependent in mice [96, 97] and observed also in adult BALB/c mice [98]. Apoptosis was more prominent in luminal than basal cells in BALB/c mice [92] and Sprague–Dawley rats [93]. At high doses (e.g. 4 Gy), reproductive cell death was more prominently induced in basal than luminal progenitor cells of Sprague–Dawley rats, whereas the effects were comparable at lower doses (e.g. 1 Gy) [93] (Fig. 4). In consistence, the percentage of basal cells decreased in BALB/c mice at 48 h after irradiation at 4 Gy [99]. Thus, importantly, acute high-dose exposure is more likely to induce imbalance between basal and luminal cells than chronic low-dose-rate exposure.Fig. 4Reproductive cell death of different mammary epithelial progenitors in rat mammary gland. Flow-sorted rat mammary epithelial cells were irradiated with γ-rays and colony formation was assessed. Adapted from Kudo et al. [93] (© 2023 Radiation Research Society). 
Intercellular signaling Evidence obtained with BALB/c mice suggests that activation of Trp53 after an acute high dose (5 Gy) exposure requires external TGFβ signaling activated by the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone [94, 95, 100]. Another line of evidence suggests stromal TGFβ is also required for various radiation-induced cancer-promoting effects, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, microenvironmental changes permissive for mammary stem cell activity and tumor formation and induction of stem cell-like status in epithelial cells (i.e. expression of both basal and luminal markers), all of which show a ‘switch-like’ (or all-or-none) dose response having a very low threshold below 100 mGy [101–103]. Such switch-like dose response can be a basis for dose rate effect. 
Alteration of physiology and homeostasis. Acute high dose exposure (2 Gy) induced increased cell proliferation in post-pubertal Sprague–Dawley rats and C57BL/6 J mice [104, 105]. In mice, this long-term effect was attributed to elevation of blood estrogen, activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and gene expression changes in the mammary epithelium [105, 106]. 
Development of premalignant lesions. Acute single irradiation at a high dose (2 Gy) induced hyperplastic changes in TEBs of the Sprague–Dawley rat mammary gland after 8 weeks [104].Digestive systemThe digestive system comprises organs that extend from the mouth to the anus covered by epithelial cells. These organs of the digestive system consist of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum), aerodigestive tract (oral cavity and pharynx), esophagus and anal canal [107]. There is sufficient evidence that ionizing radiation has a carcinogenic effect on the gastrointestinal tract in human [88]. The tissue weighting factors of colon and stomach is 0.12, and esophagus is 0.04 [4] whereas the risk of radiation-induced cancer of the mouth and small intestine is extremely smaller than in these organs, so they are included in remainder tissues. The difference in susceptibility to cancer between small and large intestine could suggest that region-dependent tissue metabolism could affect dose-rate-effects, although the animal experiments on the dose-rate effects on the gastrointestinal tract are limited. In this section, we mainly describe the dose-rate effects on small and large intestine, for which informative results have been reported from several animal experiments. 
Architecture, development and maintenance. General features of the digestive tract were well reviewed in ICRP 2012 [107]. Briefly, the stomach is a large muscular organ connecting the esophagus at the cardia and the small intestine at the pyloric sphincter in the gastrointestinal tract. The volume of the stomach was assumed to be 30 cm3 and 175 cm3 in human newborns and adults, respectively [108]. The gastric epithelium is a single layer of cells continuing with the basal layer of the stratified epithelium of the esophagus. Differentiated epithelial cells within gastric pits secrete hydrochloric acid, digestive enzymes and mucus [107]. In the mouse pyloric stomach, Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) was identified as a marker for self-renewing multipotent stem cells responsible for the long-term renewal of the gastric epithelium [109], as well as in the small and large intestine [110]. Recently, the membrane protein aquaporin 5 (AQP5) was identified as a marker that enriched for not only mouse but human adult pyloric stem cells [111]. AQP5+ stem cells exist in the pyloric gland bases. In addition, AQP5+ cells are source of gastric cancer, and AQP5+ tumor cells show ex vivo stemness.Structural and cellular features of the intestine have been thoroughly described in ICRP (2012) [107] and Hendry and Otsuka [112] (Fig. 5). Epithelial cells are continuingly generated from intestinal stem cells in the crypts, migrate upward along the crypt–villus axis and are eliminated by apoptosis at the tip of the villi, with a turnover time of 4–5 days in mice [113]. The cell-cycle time for the majority of proliferating cells may be of the order of 12–13 h, and the time for crypt stem cells is longer at approximately 24 h in mice [107]. The cell cycle time in the human intestine is in the order of 30 and 39 h for the colon and the rectum, respectively. The stem cell cycle in human colonic crypts is stated as approximately 36 h [112–114]. It was estimated that there are ~5 × 107 crypts in the small intestine in man [114]. The length of the small intestine is ~270 cm, the diameter is about 2 cm and the surface area is ~1620 cm2. Therefore, the crypt density is ~3 × 104 per cm2. Crypt density in the colon may be 2 × 104 per cm2 or even less. The human colon is ~110 cm long, the diameter is ~5 cm and the surface area is ~1650 cm2. Thus, there are <3 × 107 crypts in the large intestine in man [107, 112]. Recent studies indicated that approximately six functional stem cells at the very base of each colonic crypt in mice [115] and approximately seven stem cells in humans [116].Fig. 5Architecture of mouse intestine.Intestinal stem cells exist at the bottom of crypts. The small cycling cells between Paneth cells are known as crypt base columnar (CBC) cells [117], and the Lgr5 is one of the molecular markers for CBC cells. In the case of the intestinal crypts, Lgr5+ CBCs generate Wnt producing Paneth cells [110]. Lgr5+ CBCs in the crypt bottom are interspersed with Paneth cells supplying Wnt proteins to maintain adjacent Lgr5+ CBCs. Paneth cells thus constitute the niche for Lgr5+ stem cells in the small intestine [118]. The other various intestinal stem cell markers have been reported to indicate differences in the characteristics of stem cells, and this has been reviewed by Hendry and Otsuka [112]. Cells located at the 4th position from the crypt base (P4) in the small intestine are the quiescent stem cells expressing B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi1), homeodomain-only protein (Hopx), leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (Lrig1), and/or high level of sex determining region Y box 9 (Sox9high). In addition, very few quiescent stem cells that express extremely mouse telomerase reverse-transcriptase (mTert) are extremely resistant to a high dose (10 Gy) of radiation and can reconstitute all cell types in the small intestine [119]. On the other hand, Lgr5-positive stem cells are resistant to 1 Gy of irradiation but sensitive to 10 Gy [110]. Intermediate filament keratin-19 (Krt19)-positive and Lgr5-negative cells also have been identified as radioresistant stem cells located above P4 in both the small intestine and colon [120]. Also, the molecular markers of CBC cells have been identified including olfactomedin 4 (Olfm4), achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2), Sox9low, etc. in addition to Lgr5. Colorectal Lgr5-positive stem cells were more radiosensitive than small intestinal those [121]. 
Dose-rate effect. To discuss dose-rate effect accurately, informative data sets that have complete dose response information obtained for different dose rates are required. However, animal experiments of dose-rate effects on the gastrointestinal tract are limited (Table 4).Table 4Summary of animal studies comparing the effects of acute and chronic exposures on digestive tractSpecies (strain)Part of irradiationAnalysisRadiation sourceDose, dose rateEffect, continuous or fractionatedEffect, acute singleReferenceRat(Wistar)Female3–6 MEntire stomachSurvival, body weight, subchronic stomach dilatationX, 300 kVp10.7 and 21.3 Gy (single), 7.8–15.6 Gy (2 fractions), 3.6–9.9 Gy (5 fractions), 3 Gy/minSurvival225 days after 2F/24 ha142 days after 2F/4 weeksb231 days after 5F/4 daysc181 days after 5F/4 weeksdSubchronic stomach dilatation (ED50)23.0 Gy (2F/24 ha)20.3 Gy (2F/4 weeksb)29.5 Gy (5F/4 daysc)39.9 Gy (5F/4 weeksd)Survival70 days after irradiation Subchronic stomach dilatation (ED50)15.7 Gy[122]Mouse(B6D2F1)Male10–12 WWhole bodyApoptotic cell death in the cryptγ, 60Coγ, 137CsX, 300 kVpn, 14.7 MeVn, 600 MeV2.7, 5.3, 820 mGy/min4.5 Gy/min0.6 Gy/min2.5, 5, 250 mGy/min1, 3 mGy/minApoptotic cell deatheNo significant effect of dose-rate 2.7–4500 mGy/min (γ, 60Co or 137Cs)No significant effect of dose-rate 2.5–250 mGy/min (n, 14.7 MeV)[123]Mouse(C3H)Female9–10 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0.02, 0.08, 0.36, 1.2, 4 Gy/min (1–20 fractions)Crypt cell survivalα/β = 96 Gy (0.08 Gy/min)Crypt cell survivalα/β = 13.3 Gy (1.2 Gy/min)[124]Mouse(C3Hf/Bu)8–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 137Cs2.85 Gy/min (1–20 fractions)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.75 Gy (2F, 9–12 Gy/F)D0 = 2.23 Gy (3F, 6.25–9 Gy/F)D0 = 2.83 Gy (5F, 4.2–6.3 Gy/F)D0 = 3.34 Gy (10F, 2.8–4.4 Gy/F)D0 = 4.21 Gy (15F, 1.9–3.2 Gy/F)D0 = 4.05 Gy (20F, 1.55–2.55 Gy/F)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.42 Gy (13.4–19.2 Gy)[125]Mouse(C3Hf/Bu)Female8–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Con, 50 MeVn, 16 MeV~ 1 Gy/min (20 fractions)0.8–0.9 Gy/min (1–5 fractions)0.25 Gy/min (1–5 fractions)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.06 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 2F, 3.5–5 Gy/F)D0 = 1.08 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 3F, 2.3–3.5 Gy/F)D0 = 1.23 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 5F, 1.35–2.25 Gy/F)D0 = 0.85 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 2F, 2.5–4 Gy/F)D0 = 0.72 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 3F, 1.7–3.3 Gy/F)D0 = 0.87 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 5F, 0.9–1.9 Gy/F)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 0.93 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 6.5–10 Gy)D0 = 0.81 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 4–10 Gy)[136]Mouse(BALB/c, C.B-17/scid)10–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co16, 600 mGy/minCrypt cell survivalscidα = 0.74 ± 0.07 (Gy−1)BALB/cα = 0.22 ± 0.02Crypt cell survivalscidα/β = 4.9 ± 4.5 (α = 0.50 ± 0.24 (Gy−1), β = 0.10 ± 0.05 (Gy−2))BALB/cα/β = 4.3 ± 4.7 (α = 0.14 ± 0.11 (Gy−1), β = 0.032 ± 0.010 (Gy−2))[127]Mouse(FVB/atm KO)Whole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0–40 Gy (17 mGy/min (= 1 Gy/h))Crypt cell survivalatm KOα = 0.60 ± 0.10 (Gy−1)FVBα = 0.17 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)-[128]Mouse(129Sv/C57BL/6/Trp53 KO, C57BL/6/bcl-2 KO, B6D2F1)10–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0–45 Gy (17 mGy/min (= 1 Gy/h))Crypt cell survivalTrp53+/+α = 0.13 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)Trp53+/−α = 0.090 ± 0.010 (Gy−1)Trp53−/−α = 0.031 ± 0.007 (Gy−1)Bcl-2+/+α = 0.14 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)Bcl-2+/−α = 0.19 ± 0.03 (Gy−1)Bcl-2−/−α = 0.19 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)B6D2F1α = 0.15 ± 0.01 (Gy−1)-[129]Mouse(Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 × ROSA26-LSL-LacZ)1 MWhole bodyStem cell replacement (Lgr5 lineage tracing)X, 260 kVpγ, 137Cs1 Gy (0.5 Gy/min)1 Gy (0.05 mGy/min)Colonic LacZ+ crypts (%)2.05 ± 0.79 (Sham)1.78 ± 0.73 (1 Gy, 0.05 mGy/min)Colonic LacZ+ crypts (%)1.98 ± 0.55 (Sham)1.40 ± 0.06 (1 Gy, 0.5Gy/min)[130]

eincidence of apoptotic bodies in crypt section [123]. KO, knockout.In the rat stomach, localized 300 kV X-irradiation with single and fractionated (two and five fractions given daily and in 4 weeks, which was called as subchronic exposure) doses was reported [122]. Between 4 and 40 weeks after irradiation subchronic radiation damage was observed which presented itself as atonic dilatation of the stomach, with a α/β value range of 4.8–5.3 Gy. In the five-fraction experiment a significant increase in tolerance amounting to 800 mGy/day for the acute effect and 400 mGy/day for the subchronic effect was observed when intervals were increased from 1 day to 1 week.In the mouse small intestine, induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min [123]. Some P4 stem cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by radiation at doses as low as 100 mGy. The lack of a dose-rate effect may be due to the dose-rate used being so high that all of the stem cells were uniformly irradiated. However, these results suggest that during chronic irradiation, continuous deletion of damaged cells and their replacement may occur [88]. On the other hand, the fractionation effect of jejunal crypt survival after fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) of C3H mice given at 1.2 Gy/min was more valid than at 80 mGy/min [124]. The α/β value calculated by using linear-quadratic model was 13.3 Gy at 1.2 Gy/min and 96 Gy at 80 mGy/min, respectively. Recovery of cell survival by multifractionated irradiation with γ-rays was also reported in mouse (C3Hf/Bu) jejunal and colonic crypts [125, 126].Under low dose-rate irradiation condition, any repair occur during irradiation, and therefore the extrapolation of the near-exponential portion of the crypt survival curve to zero dose, which was called back-extrapolation, could represent the pre-irradiation number of clonogens per crypt (clonogens were defined as cells that grow clonally). Additionally, the low dose-rate slope of the near-exponential portion could represent the αcomponent of a conventional linear-quadratic type survival curve [112]. In the scid mice having mutations on the Prkdc (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; DNA-PKcs), the α value was 0.74 ± 0.07 Gy−1, compared to 0.22 ± 0.02 Gy−1 in the parental Balb/c mice, indicating that scid mice are ~3-fold more sensitive and the back-extrapolation was similar in both cases at a common value of 20 ± 6 [112, 127]. Therefore, clonogen radiosensitivity was increased about 3-fold higher by scid mutation, although the clonogen content per crypt was not different. Similar results were also obtained in the study using atm knockout mice [128]. In the Atm−/− mice, the back-extrapolation was 12 ± 6, and α = 0.60 ± 0.10 Gy−1, compared to 13 ± 6 and α = 0.17 ± 0.02 Gy−1 in the parental wild-type FVB mice [112, 128]. Crypt survival in small intestine was also investigated using Trp53 and Bcl-2 knockout mice at 0.017 Gy/min (1 Gy/h) of 60Co γ-rays [129]. Crypt survival levels were higher in Trp53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy, but not after lower or higher doses. Similarly, crypt survival in Bcl2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl2+/+ and Bcl2+/− mice. These results suggest that the degree of curvature of the dose–response curve at a high dose-rate levels for some genotypes is not expected at lower dose-rate.Lgr5+ stem cells in the mouse colon were much more radiosensitive than those in duodenum, because the number of colonic Lgr5+ stem cells decreased significantly after exposure to high dose-rate (0.5 Gy/min) X-rays at a dose 1 Gy [121]. Therefore, using the Lgr5-lineage tracing technique, the effects of low dose-rate (0.05 mGy/min) γ-rays on the replenishment of colonic Lgr5+ stem cells could be measured [130]. Unlike high dose-rate irradiation, which significantly promoted replenishment of Lgr5+ stem cells, no significant acceleration of stem cell replenishment was observed upon low-dose-rate irradiation. 
Possible ‘key events’ related to dose rate effect in the digestive system Key events of the AOP related to the dose-rate effect, especially under low dose-rate irradiation condition, are not completely clear for the tissues/organs including digestive system. Therefore, the key events described below were mainly obtained by the studies using high dose and high dose-rate radiations. Importantly, a few recent studies have suggested that stem cell competition is one of the most important key events of the dose-rate effect in the intestine. For example, using stem cell-derived organoid culture system, irradiation at low dose-rates was shown to more efficiently eliminate damaged cells. Thus, the stem cell competition could provide a mechanism underlying the sparing effect of low-dose-rate irradiation [90]. 
DNA damage responses. The kinetics of 53BP1 foci formation, a surrogate marker for DSBs, has been studied in the mouse small intestine (duodenum and ileum) and colon irradiated with high dose-rate X-rays at doses 0.1, 1 or 4 Gy [131]. In the small intestine and colon, 53BP1 foci were similarly detected immediately after irradiation, but rapidly disappeared thereafter, especially noticeably in Lgr5+ stem cells. In contrast, the colon was more susceptible to radiation-induced formation of 53BP1 foci. Additionally, the formation of γ-H2AX, BRCA1, RAD51 and phospho-DNA-PKcs at T2609 foci was studied in the mouse small intestinal CBC cells [132]. CBCs are relatively radioresistant, repairing DNA by HR significantly more efficiently than transit amplifying progenitors or villus cells. On the other hand, radiosensitivity of intestinal clonogens was increased in the Prkdc-mutated scid mice and Atm knockout mice [112, 127, 128]. The DNA repair kinetics is also different between CBCs and the Lgr5+ mouse colonic epithelial stem cells (CESCs). After 19 Gy of whole body irradiation with high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) of γ-rays, CBCs and CESCs resolved γ-H2AX foci at different rates with CBCs repairing DSBs more slowly, a difference that persisted until at least 18 h after irradiation, a time at which CESCs had fully recovered [133]. 
Intracellular signaling. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcriptional regulator of genes encoding antioxidant and anti-inflammation enzymes that binds to its endogenous inhibitor protein, Kelch-like ECH (erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology)-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1), in the cytoplasm. Upon irradiation, Nrf2 is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to induce transcription of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and other cytoprotective enzymes through binding to antioxidant responsive elements. Mice fed with 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO)-ethyl amide (EA), which is the chemically modified derivative of the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO showed resistance to TBI at a dose of 7.5 Gy. Mice fed with CDDO-EA were also greatly protected from TBI-induced reduction in crypt size, number, cell density and villus length in both the colon and small intestine as well as the induction of apoptosis in colonic crypts [134]. Also, studies showing the importance of intracellular redox potential of glutathione in cell proliferation, cellular differentiation and cell death by apoptosis in intestinal epithelium were precisely reviewed [135], but its contribution to the dose-rate effect has not yet been well cleared. 
Gene expression. The expression levels of Trp53 and Cdkn1a (p21) increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in mouse small and large intestine after 8 Gy of high dose-rate irradiation with 137Cs γ-rays (3.8 Gy/min) [136]. In the small intestine, both Trp53 and Cdkn1a expressions were observed throughout crypts with the greatest frequency of expression over the first 15 cell positions, which includes the stem cell population (positions 3 to 5 and their vicinity) and the proliferating, transit cell population (positions 5 to 15 and their vicinity). Interestingly, cells expressing Trp53 were primarily distributed toward the crypt base. Subdivision of the Trp53-positive cell population revealed that the cells with the strongest Trp53 immunoreactivity were positioned farther toward the crypt base, and their distribution was almost coincident with the frequency distribution of apoptotic cells. Cells that were either weakly or moderately immunoreactive for Trp53 were located toward the middle of the crypt and were nearly coincident with the distribution of Cdkn1a. In the large intestine, Trp53 and Cdkn1a were observed along the entire length of the colonic crypts, and, unlike in the small intestine, this expression was not only maintained but increased over 72 h. The expression of Cdkn1a was detected in the colonic epithelium up to 6 days after irradiation. The expression of Cdkn1a could not be clearly detected 4 h after irradiation at a dose of 0.3 Gy in both small and large intestine. Meanwhile, after 1 Gy of high dose-rate (1.5 Gy/min) X-irradiation, the expression levels of Cdkn1a (p21) and Mdm2 increased significantly in the colon, but not in the duodenum, suggesting that the p53-dependent DNA damage response preferentially occurs in the colon, while the expression of Bax increased significantly in both organs [121]. 
Cell cycle regulation. In crypts of the mouse small and large intestine, irradiation with 8 Gy of 137Cs γ-rays (3.8 Gy/min) severely reduced thymidine incorporation [136]. The incorporation of thymidine was gradually recovered, however, it returned to the normal level by 72 h after irradiation. Cells re-entering the cell cycle (i.e. thymidine-labeled cells) were observed at a lower position in the crypts. Also, preferential cell loss in the lower crypt was observed in mouse colon irradiated with X-rays at a high dose rate (0.5 Gy/min) [131]. Considerable reduction of cell numbers and dramatic induction of mitosis were observed after low-dose (0.1 Gy) X-irradiation in the colon but not in the small intestine. In a study of using the 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining method, small intestinal CBCs began cycling 12 h after 19 Gy of whole-body irradiation at a high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays and by 15 h, maximal division was reinstituted [133]. Interestingly, it was estimated that about 60% of the small intestinal CBCs have not completed DNA repair at the time cell division reinitiates [133]. On the contrary, mouse CESCs began to exit growth arrest at 24 h after irradiation, and recovered their cycling levels by 48 h [133]. The kinetics of γ-H2AX indicated that DSBs were repaired by 18 h, a time preceding the checkpoint recovery initiation. 
Cell death. In mouse stomach irradiated with 137Cs γ-rays (2.6 Gy/min), maximum numbers of apoptotic cells were observed in both antrum and corpus at 48 h after irradiation at doses greater than 12 Gy [140]. However, the number of apoptotic cells observed in the gastric epithelium was much lower than observed in the small intestine or colon after similar doses of radiation. The greatest numbers of apoptotic cells were observed at cell positions 5–6 in the antrum and cell positions 15–18 in the corpus.Radiation-induced apoptotic cell death in the intestine has already been thoroughly reviewed [107, 112]. In both duodenal and colonic crypts, caspase-3 positive cells were observed 6 h after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (1.5 Gy/min), and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected 24 h after irradiation. The frequency of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive crypts showed that the frequency of apoptotic cells in crypts increased after 1 Gy of X-irradiation in both duodenum and colon [121]. As described above, it was reported that induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min in the mouse small intestine [123]. Crypt survival levels were higher in p53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy [137], and crypt survival of Bcl-2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl-2+/+ and Bcl-2+/− mice [129]. Additionally, significant alteration in the expression level of 26 autophagy and 17 oxidative stress-related genes was induced in the mouse jejunal-ileal region of the small intestine after exposure to 2 Gy of high dose-rate γ-rays (700 mGy/min) [138]. Immunoprobing of intestinal sections showed decreased autophagosome marker LC3-II in the intestinal epithelial cells after irradiation. The mitotic catastrophe in the small intestinal crypts was 8 times higher than in the colonic crypts at 48 h after 19 Gy of whole-body irradiation at a high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays [133]. 
Intercellular signaling. Many kinds of modifiers of gastrointestinal toxicity mediated by radiation, including interleukins, growth factors and cytokines, have been reported and reviewed by ICRP (2012) [107] and Hendry and Otsuka [112], however those mitigators are beyond the scope of this review. In the intestine, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for the renewal of the intestines [139]. Disruption of Wnt signaling led to an abrupt cessation of proliferation in intestinal crypts following unbated loss of intestinal tissue and often morbidity. Reciprocally, the Wnt co-agonist R-spondin could potently stimulate intestinal proliferation. Lgr5 is well known as one of the Wnt target genes. Although the negligible effect of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells loss during homeostasis [140], depletion of Lgr5+ cells during radiation (10 Gy)-induced damage and subsequent repair caused catastrophic crypt loss and deterioration of crypt-villus architecture [141]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also well known to act as the intercellular signaling molecules. As described above, alteration of oxidative stress-related genes, as well as autophagy-related genes, was induced in the mouse jejunal-ileal region of the small intestine after exposure to 2 Gy of high dose-rate γ-rays (0.7 Gy/min) [138]. Radiation exposure led to persistently increased oxidant production and decreased anti-oxidant gene expression leading to oxidative stress and activation of proliferative Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt)) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. 
Alteration of physiology and homeostasis. Chronic exposures at a dose rate of a few mGy per year indicate that every cell in the body will be hit by a track of radiation every few months. This then makes a hit stem cell, at any time, compete against surrounding non-hit stem cells with in a niche. ICRP (2015) [90] described that ‘if the elemental dose affects that stemness, the hit cells will be preferentially lost by competition from the tissue stem cell niche.’ And ‘Hence, stem cell competition at the tissue levels an ample possibility for a DREF value larger than unity, as in the case of the current DDREF value used by ICRP.’ Recently, the gene expression profiles of in the mouse colonic Lgr5+ stem cells, which were harvested by cell sorting at 2 weeks after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (0.5 Gy/min) or low dose-rate (0.05 mGy/min) γ-rays, were analyzed to identify key molecules that determine the dose-rate effects on the stem cell pool by RNA-sequence [142]. In the Lgr5+ stem cells irradiated with high dose-rate X-rays, pathways related to DNA damage response, cell growth, cell differentiation and cell death were upregulated. Interestingly, pathways related to apical junctions and extracellular signaling were upregulated in the colonic Lgr5+ stem cells irradiated with low dose-rate γ-rays. Apical junctions are known to play an important role in the exclusion of transformed cells that are surrounded by normal epithelial cells through ‘cell competition.’ Therefore, cell competition, through apical junctions and extracellular ligands, might contribute to the dose-rate effect on Lgr5+ cell replenishment.However, it is very difficult to evaluate radiation-induced stem cell competition under low dose-rate irradiation conditions in vivo. Recently, an organoid, having a crypt–villus-like structure [143], have been generated from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells at high efficiency in vitro. The intestinal organoid reflected the intestinal epithelium in vivo, because it contained all types of differentiated cells of the epithelium. The organoid-forming efficiency of irradiated cells relative to that of unirradiated controls could be defined as the surviving fraction of stem cells. Enzymatically dissociated single crypt cells from the duodenum and jejunum of mice were irradiated with 7.25, 29, 101, 304, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mGy of high dose-rate (100–470 mGy/min) X-rays immediately after plating, and the number of organoids was counted on day 12 [144]. A significant decrease in the surviving fraction of stem cells at approximately 1000 mGy. In a more recent study, Fujimichi et al. [145] established a two-color organoid culture system by mixing stem cells expressing different fluorescent colors. To analyze stem cell competition, two-color organoids were formed by mixing high dose-rate (0.5 Gy/min) X-irradiated and non-irradiated intestinal stem cells. In the two-color organoids, irradiated stem cells at a dose 1 Gy exhibited a growth disadvantage, although the organoid-forming potential (OFP) of the irradiated cells alone did not differ significantly from that of non-irradiated cells. This suggested that irradiated stem cells may become losers by the stem cell competition with non-irradiated cells, although more studies are needed to assess the effects of lower doses and lower dose-rates. 
Development of premalignant lesions. At 24 h after 19 Gy of whole body irradiation with high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays, mitotic cells in both the small and large intestines showed aberrant mitoses including anaphase bridges, multipolar spindles, misaligned chromosomes and chromosomal lagging [133]. Aberrant mitotic figures in small intestinal crypts were 8-fold higher than in large intestinal crypts. Additionally, in the study using Lgr5DTR mice, in which the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is knocked into the endogenous Lgr5 locus, the crypts, deficient for Lgr5+ cells, are competent to undergo hyperplasia upon loss of Apc [142]. It suggests that Lgr5− reserve intestinal stem cells are radiosensitive, and Lgr5+ cells are crucial for robust intestinal regeneration following radiation exposure, but are dispensable for premalignant hyperproliferation.

STUDIES TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DOSE-RATE EFFECTS

To gain mechanistic insights into dose-rate effects it is critical to overview both in vitro and in vivo studies with respect to the fundamental mechanisms. Thus, this section specifically extracts in vitro experiments towards the initial critical key events, i.e. induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and mutations, and attempts to rephrase the interpretation of the results.

Summary of in vitro studiesInduction of DSBs in cells at low doseSeveral previous studies that have investigated dose-rate effects on DSB induction, all of which showed linear dose-dependent induction of DSBs at high doses and high-dose-rates. Although it was rather difficult to quantify the number of DSBs induced by low-dose radiation exposure at a low-dose-rate, it is now possible through the application of surrogate markers for DSBs. This is because such DSB markers are sensitive enough to detect even a single DSB within a cell [41]. Among surrogate DSB markers the foci of phosphorylated histone H2AX at serine 139, called γ-H2AX foci, appear to be the earliest one and used widely in such studies [42]. Since ATM-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AX expands over several megabases of chromatin [43], phosphorylation is detectable as discrete dots, which are called foci, under a microscope [41], by using a specific monoclonal antibody [44, 45]. There are other DNA damage repair and response factors, which can serve as the markers for DSBs as well [46, 47].The linear dose–response of γ-H2AX foci was evident between 1.2 mGy and 2 Gy delivered at a high-dose-rate in normal human cells [48], which was confirmed by others [46, 49]. It was claimed that DSBs induced by very low doses were more repairable than those induced by higher doses [48]. For example, the excess amount of DSBs induced by 5 mGy or 20 mGy of X-rays was found to decrease significantly within 24 h after X-irradiation. Similar efficient repair of DSBs caused by low-dose γ-rays was reported elsewhere [49].DSBs induced at a low-dose-rate radiationTo investigate continuous low-dose radiation exposure, unique radiation exposure facilities have been established [50]. For example, the effects of high- (1.8 Gy/min) and low- (0.3 mGy/min) dose-rate radiation exposure were compared [51]. Whereas exposure to high-dose-rate radiation led to a linear increase in γ-H2AX foci, the same total dose, delivered at low-dose-rate, showed a very small increase within the first 2 days. Another study indicated that, during the 4-days irradiation, the accumulation of foci was observed from day 2 to 4 only by exposure at 0.694 mGy/min not at 0.007, 0.069 and 0.347 mGy/min [52], indicating the balance between the induction of DSBs and their repair is crucial.As discussed previously, a single DSB has little ability to cause large-scale genome rearrangement, which is one of the critical events leading to cancer [53]. Therefore, even with the same total dose, dose delivered at high-dose-rate can induce multiple DSBs simultaneously in the same cell. In contrast, the same dose but delivered at low-dose-rate can result in spatially and temporally isolated DSBs in different cells, indicating the DREF value should be more than 1. It is well documented that DSBs caused by low-linear energy transfer (LET) radiation are efficiently repaired, although it is also claimed that even a single DSB may be accompanied by a cluster of DNA damage including single-strand breaks and base damage [54]. Furthermore, the possibility that a single radiation track causes two or more DSBs in close proximity has been raised. Such possibility still remains to be explored [55].Detection of DNA double strand breaks in vivoApplications of foci of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 have also been attempted in animal studies [56–59]. It was found that 10 mGy of X-rays delivered at 2 Gy/min increased 53BP1 foci as well as γ-H2AX foci in the heart, small intestine and kidney [56]. The reduction in the excess foci indicated that the induced DSBs were reparable when mice were exposed to 100 mGy, while those induced by 10 mGy decreased slightly but not completely even after 72 h of irradiation [58]. Therefore, 10 mGy daily irradiation repeated up to 50 times did not change the focus levels in enterocytes, but resulted in the accumulation of foci in cortical neurons, skin keratinocytes and hair follicles. Thus, even at low dose, DSBs accumulated in tissues, when radiation was delivered at 2 Gy/min.Accumulation of DSBs by continuous irradiation at a very low-dose-rate was examined by using mice in cages were kept on the flood phantom filled with 125I-containing buffer [60]. The low-dose-rate was 0.0017 mGy/min (2.4 mGy/day), while high-dose-rate used was 71 mGy/min and the total dose was 105 mGy, Detectable increase in DNA damage was observed at 71 mGy/min but not at 0.0017 mGy/min [60].Foci formation was sometimes not apparent in tissues/organs. For example, the human skin basal layers showed focus, while the granular and cornified layers did not develop foci [47]. Similar results were obtained in lung, liver and intestine [58, 59]. Although limitations of sensitivity of detection systems using surrogate markers should be considered, the focus formation was undetectable in heterochromatinized nuclei in terminally differentiated cells [47]. For example, small intestinal crypt cells are highly efficient in inducing foci, which was gradually decreased in the villous regions (Fig. 2). These results clearly demonstrate that activation of DNA damage response, which results in the foci formation, is not executed in terminally differentiated cells. Thus, from the biological point of view, a certain fraction of cells in tissues/organs, such as terminally differentiated cells, could not be the cell origin of cancer. Under the low-dose-rate exposure situation, exposed cells may undergo differentiation before the total accumulated dose is delivered, providing one possible mechanism for dose-rate effects in vivo.Fig. 253BP1 foci in the mouse small intestine 6 h after 4.0 Gy of X-rays. Multiple foci were induced in the crypt region, while they were rarely detected in villi, indicating that, although DSBs should be induced in every cell, but the DNA damage response, i.e. accumulation of 53BP1, is dependent on differentiation status.

Summary of knowledge acquired from animal models of cancer developmentLarge scale animal experiments have defined the dose- and dose-rate-dependency of cancer induction, and more recently, mechanistic insights at the molecular levels, such as DNA damage induction, DNA damage repair and DNA damage response, which are the closely related issues to radiation carcinogenesis, are discussed in detail with respect to genomic instability and mutagenesis [61]. Thus, this section reviews dose-rate effects in animal experiments concerning bone marrow, mammary gland, digestive tract, lung and liver and discusses the possible underlying mechanisms with respect to AOP.Mammary glandBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Epidemiological studies such as those on atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors have demonstrated that radiation exposure is its major risk factor, and increased risk related with radiation dose and the age at exposure [62]. 
Architecture, development and maintenance. The mammary gland is a tree of branching ducts, consisting of an outer layer of basal (myoepithelial) cells and inner layer of luminal cells (Fig. 3). Species differences does exist between rodents and humans in terms of architecture [63, 64]. In rodents, mammary ducts end in either terminal end buds ([TEB] sites of post-pubertal ductal elongation), terminal ducts and lobuloalveolus and the intra-lobular stroma is scanty (Fig. 3). In humans, mammary ducts end in the terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) with rich fibroblastic stroma. The human TDLU is a site at which breast cancer frequently develops and is considered as comparable to the lobuloalveolus and TEBs of rodents [63, 64]. In mice, the fetal gland consists of bipotent cells (i.e. capable of giving rise to basal and luminal lineages), which after birth turn into lineage-restricted basal and luminal progenitors that independently maintain the gland, with some controversial evidence has suggested the existence of long-term bipotent stem cells in adulthood [65]. In rodents, most of the mammary epithelial cells are produced during the post-pubertal development at TEB, which after maturation differentiate into either terminal ducts or lobuloalveolar buds in rodents [64]. Lobuloalveoli undergo extensive growth during pregnancy and lactation, and cessation of lactation induces their involution and remodeling in rodents, a change which is rather mild in human [65].Fig. 3Architecture of rodent mammary gland.Mammary epithelial cells undergo cyclic waves of proliferation and death in association with menstrual (~28 days, human) and estrous (4–5 days, mice and rats) cycles [66–68]. In both mice and rats, the progeny of proliferative cells, detected via intense labeling after a few weeks’ administration of bromodeoxyuridine, was found to steadily decrease with time and reach one tenth after ~2 months [69, 70], whereas in mice, basal and luminal progenitor cells continue to exist at least for 10 weeks [71, 72], indicating longer life of progenitor cells than differentiated cells. Life of mammary cells in human is not understood.As ovarian hormones direct development of mammary gland, they also play key roles in mammary carcinogenesis. Early menopause is associated with reduced breast cancer risk in women, and in both rodents and human, high radiation dose (over 2–5 Gy) to ovaries has been associated with early ovarian dysfunction and a reduction in radiation-associated breast cancer risk [73–75]. The effect on the ovary is lower at a low dose rate [76]. 
Dose-rate effect in radiation carcinogenesis. A series of experimental studies with rats and mice have been conducted. Data obtained from the comparison between the high dose-rate and low dose-rate exposure have provided rather conflicting results [77–88] (Table 3). It seems likely that dose-rate effects are affected by physiological factors. In fact, continuous administration of estrogen was reported to uncover dose-rate effects [83], consistent with the more recent finding that the dose-rate effect is more prominent in post-pubertal than peri-pubertal rats [76].Table 3Mammary carcinogenesis studies comparing the effects of acute and chronic exposuresI.FractionationSpecies (strain)RadiationEffect measureAcute exposure dose responseDose per fraction (interval time)Exposure periodTotal dose (Gy)Age when exposure startedEffect, fractionatedEffect, acute singleReferenceMouse (BALB/c)γ, 137Cs% with tumor (age-adjusted)Linear-quadratic10 mGy (1 d)50 mGy (1 d)25 d5 d0.2512 wk0.2%a9.7%12.3%[77]Rat (Sprague–‌Dawley)γ, 60CoIncrease in tumor no.Linear0.14–1.1 Gy (0.5 wk)2–16 wk4.46 wk3–6/103 MDb2–3/103 MD[78, 79]Rat (WAG/Rij)XTime to detectionNot analyzed0.2 Gy (1 mo)10 mo2.08 wk143 wkc139 wk[81]Rat (WAG/Rij)γ, 137CsExcess normalized riskLinear2.5–10 mGy (0.5 d)8–56 wk1 or 28 wk0.9–1.2/Gyd1.1/Gy[82, 84]Rat (WAG/Rij), estrogen-treatedγ, 137CsExcess normalized riskSigmoid2.5–40 mGy (0.5 d)2–56 wk1 or 28 wk0.6–2.4/Gyd7.7 at 1 Gye[83, 84]II.

Possible ‘key events’ related to the dose rate effect. As mentioned below, studies have analyzed tissue response of mammary gland to acute single irradiation at a high dose rate. Evidence on early key events in the AOP (Table 1) suggests induction of imbalance between basal and luminal cells as a result of their differential sensitivity to radiation [89], which may be more prominent at high acute doses, providing a possible basis for dose-rate effects. Regarding later key events, stimulation of long-term cell proliferation has been observed after acute radiation exposure, indicating hormonal and microenvironmental alterations. In fact, some microenvironmental changes show a switch-like dose response with a very low threshold, providing another mechanistic basis for the dose-rate effects. Early responses and later tissue kinetics after low dose-rate exposure, including the existence of radiation-induced cell competition [90], remain an open question. 
DNA damage responses. γH2AX foci are formed at 1 h, and mostly disappear by 4 h, after a single high-dose (2–6 Gy) irradiation in basal and luminal mammary cells of BALB/c mice, Sprague–Dawley rats and human tissue xenografts and the response is generally more prominent in luminal than basal cells [91–93], although these studies did not conclude whether this also holds true for TEBs and TDLU. γH2AX induction in luminal progenitor cells and mature cells is similar and dose dependent in rats [93]. Basal cells might have high non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity in BALB/c mice [92], although, controversially, they are prone to radiation-induced cell death as mentioned below. Focus formation of Rad51 was not detected in irradiated human mammary tissue xenograft, indicating a minor role for homologous recombination (HR) repair [91]. 
Intracellular signaling. Following the aforementioned initial responses to high dose radiation (2–5 Gy), Trp53 protein, which is a nuclear protein, is phosphorylated by nuclear kinases, such ATM and DNA-PK, in cells of the post-pubertal BALB/c mouse mammary ducts and human tissue xenografts after 1 h and is redistributed to cytoplasm in luminal cells at 4–6 h whereas it remains in the nucleus in basal cells [91, 94–96]. Trp53 may induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, the latter possibly being regulated in parallel by Brca2 [97]. 
Gene expression. Activation of Trp53 as mentioned above induces expression of Cdkn1a (p21) in BALB/c mouse mammary ducts and lobuloalveoli [96]. 
Cell cycle regulation. An acute high dose (2–5 Gy) irradiation drastically decreases incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in TEB of hybrid mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ strains and Sprague–Dawley rats by 6 h, indicating induction of S phase arrest [97, 98]. In BALB/c mice, most basal and luminal cells show reduced Ki67-positive fractions after acute 6 Gy irradiation, implying entrance to G0, while a subset of proliferative basal mammary cells exhibit G2 arrest [92]. In Sprague–Dawley rats, release from cell cycle arrest occurs in basal cells by 24 h, when luminal cells show longer arrest [93]. 
Cell death. An acute high dose (2–5 Gy) irradiation induces only moderate apoptosis in mammary glands of post-pubertal BALB/c mice, hybrid mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ strains and Sprague–Dawley rats [93–96]; this was Trp53-dependent in mice [96, 97] and observed also in adult BALB/c mice [98]. Apoptosis was more prominent in luminal than basal cells in BALB/c mice [92] and Sprague–Dawley rats [93]. At high doses (e.g. 4 Gy), reproductive cell death was more prominently induced in basal than luminal progenitor cells of Sprague–Dawley rats, whereas the effects were comparable at lower doses (e.g. 1 Gy) [93] (Fig. 4). In consistence, the percentage of basal cells decreased in BALB/c mice at 48 h after irradiation at 4 Gy [99]. Thus, importantly, acute high-dose exposure is more likely to induce imbalance between basal and luminal cells than chronic low-dose-rate exposure.Fig. 4Reproductive cell death of different mammary epithelial progenitors in rat mammary gland. Flow-sorted rat mammary epithelial cells were irradiated with γ-rays and colony formation was assessed. Adapted from Kudo et al. [93] (© 2023 Radiation Research Society). 
Intercellular signaling Evidence obtained with BALB/c mice suggests that activation of Trp53 after an acute high dose (5 Gy) exposure requires external TGFβ signaling activated by the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone [94, 95, 100]. Another line of evidence suggests stromal TGFβ is also required for various radiation-induced cancer-promoting effects, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, microenvironmental changes permissive for mammary stem cell activity and tumor formation and induction of stem cell-like status in epithelial cells (i.e. expression of both basal and luminal markers), all of which show a ‘switch-like’ (or all-or-none) dose response having a very low threshold below 100 mGy [101–103]. Such switch-like dose response can be a basis for dose rate effect. 
Alteration of physiology and homeostasis. Acute high dose exposure (2 Gy) induced increased cell proliferation in post-pubertal Sprague–Dawley rats and C57BL/6 J mice [104, 105]. In mice, this long-term effect was attributed to elevation of blood estrogen, activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and gene expression changes in the mammary epithelium [105, 106]. 
Development of premalignant lesions. Acute single irradiation at a high dose (2 Gy) induced hyperplastic changes in TEBs of the Sprague–Dawley rat mammary gland after 8 weeks [104].Digestive systemThe digestive system comprises organs that extend from the mouth to the anus covered by epithelial cells. These organs of the digestive system consist of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum), aerodigestive tract (oral cavity and pharynx), esophagus and anal canal [107]. There is sufficient evidence that ionizing radiation has a carcinogenic effect on the gastrointestinal tract in human [88]. The tissue weighting factors of colon and stomach is 0.12, and esophagus is 0.04 [4] whereas the risk of radiation-induced cancer of the mouth and small intestine is extremely smaller than in these organs, so they are included in remainder tissues. The difference in susceptibility to cancer between small and large intestine could suggest that region-dependent tissue metabolism could affect dose-rate-effects, although the animal experiments on the dose-rate effects on the gastrointestinal tract are limited. In this section, we mainly describe the dose-rate effects on small and large intestine, for which informative results have been reported from several animal experiments. 
Architecture, development and maintenance. General features of the digestive tract were well reviewed in ICRP 2012 [107]. Briefly, the stomach is a large muscular organ connecting the esophagus at the cardia and the small intestine at the pyloric sphincter in the gastrointestinal tract. The volume of the stomach was assumed to be 30 cm3 and 175 cm3 in human newborns and adults, respectively [108]. The gastric epithelium is a single layer of cells continuing with the basal layer of the stratified epithelium of the esophagus. Differentiated epithelial cells within gastric pits secrete hydrochloric acid, digestive enzymes and mucus [107]. In the mouse pyloric stomach, Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) was identified as a marker for self-renewing multipotent stem cells responsible for the long-term renewal of the gastric epithelium [109], as well as in the small and large intestine [110]. Recently, the membrane protein aquaporin 5 (AQP5) was identified as a marker that enriched for not only mouse but human adult pyloric stem cells [111]. AQP5+ stem cells exist in the pyloric gland bases. In addition, AQP5+ cells are source of gastric cancer, and AQP5+ tumor cells show ex vivo stemness.Structural and cellular features of the intestine have been thoroughly described in ICRP (2012) [107] and Hendry and Otsuka [112] (Fig. 5). Epithelial cells are continuingly generated from intestinal stem cells in the crypts, migrate upward along the crypt–villus axis and are eliminated by apoptosis at the tip of the villi, with a turnover time of 4–5 days in mice [113]. The cell-cycle time for the majority of proliferating cells may be of the order of 12–13 h, and the time for crypt stem cells is longer at approximately 24 h in mice [107]. The cell cycle time in the human intestine is in the order of 30 and 39 h for the colon and the rectum, respectively. The stem cell cycle in human colonic crypts is stated as approximately 36 h [112–114]. It was estimated that there are ~5 × 107 crypts in the small intestine in man [114]. The length of the small intestine is ~270 cm, the diameter is about 2 cm and the surface area is ~1620 cm2. Therefore, the crypt density is ~3 × 104 per cm2. Crypt density in the colon may be 2 × 104 per cm2 or even less. The human colon is ~110 cm long, the diameter is ~5 cm and the surface area is ~1650 cm2. Thus, there are <3 × 107 crypts in the large intestine in man [107, 112]. Recent studies indicated that approximately six functional stem cells at the very base of each colonic crypt in mice [115] and approximately seven stem cells in humans [116].Fig. 5Architecture of mouse intestine.Intestinal stem cells exist at the bottom of crypts. The small cycling cells between Paneth cells are known as crypt base columnar (CBC) cells [117], and the Lgr5 is one of the molecular markers for CBC cells. In the case of the intestinal crypts, Lgr5+ CBCs generate Wnt producing Paneth cells [110]. Lgr5+ CBCs in the crypt bottom are interspersed with Paneth cells supplying Wnt proteins to maintain adjacent Lgr5+ CBCs. Paneth cells thus constitute the niche for Lgr5+ stem cells in the small intestine [118]. The other various intestinal stem cell markers have been reported to indicate differences in the characteristics of stem cells, and this has been reviewed by Hendry and Otsuka [112]. Cells located at the 4th position from the crypt base (P4) in the small intestine are the quiescent stem cells expressing B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi1), homeodomain-only protein (Hopx), leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (Lrig1), and/or high level of sex determining region Y box 9 (Sox9high). In addition, very few quiescent stem cells that express extremely mouse telomerase reverse-transcriptase (mTert) are extremely resistant to a high dose (10 Gy) of radiation and can reconstitute all cell types in the small intestine [119]. On the other hand, Lgr5-positive stem cells are resistant to 1 Gy of irradiation but sensitive to 10 Gy [110]. Intermediate filament keratin-19 (Krt19)-positive and Lgr5-negative cells also have been identified as radioresistant stem cells located above P4 in both the small intestine and colon [120]. Also, the molecular markers of CBC cells have been identified including olfactomedin 4 (Olfm4), achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2), Sox9low, etc. in addition to Lgr5. Colorectal Lgr5-positive stem cells were more radiosensitive than small intestinal those [121]. 
Dose-rate effect. To discuss dose-rate effect accurately, informative data sets that have complete dose response information obtained for different dose rates are required. However, animal experiments of dose-rate effects on the gastrointestinal tract are limited (Table 4).Table 4Summary of animal studies comparing the effects of acute and chronic exposures on digestive tractSpecies (strain)Part of irradiationAnalysisRadiation sourceDose, dose rateEffect, continuous or fractionatedEffect, acute singleReferenceRat(Wistar)Female3–6 MEntire stomachSurvival, body weight, subchronic stomach dilatationX, 300 kVp10.7 and 21.3 Gy (single), 7.8–15.6 Gy (2 fractions), 3.6–9.9 Gy (5 fractions), 3 Gy/minSurvival225 days after 2F/24 ha142 days after 2F/4 weeksb231 days after 5F/4 daysc181 days after 5F/4 weeksdSubchronic stomach dilatation (ED50)23.0 Gy (2F/24 ha)20.3 Gy (2F/4 weeksb)29.5 Gy (5F/4 daysc)39.9 Gy (5F/4 weeksd)Survival70 days after irradiation Subchronic stomach dilatation (ED50)15.7 Gy[122]Mouse(B6D2F1)Male10–12 WWhole bodyApoptotic cell death in the cryptγ, 60Coγ, 137CsX, 300 kVpn, 14.7 MeVn, 600 MeV2.7, 5.3, 820 mGy/min4.5 Gy/min0.6 Gy/min2.5, 5, 250 mGy/min1, 3 mGy/minApoptotic cell deatheNo significant effect of dose-rate 2.7–4500 mGy/min (γ, 60Co or 137Cs)No significant effect of dose-rate 2.5–250 mGy/min (n, 14.7 MeV)[123]Mouse(C3H)Female9–10 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0.02, 0.08, 0.36, 1.2, 4 Gy/min (1–20 fractions)Crypt cell survivalα/β = 96 Gy (0.08 Gy/min)Crypt cell survivalα/β = 13.3 Gy (1.2 Gy/min)[124]Mouse(C3Hf/Bu)8–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 137Cs2.85 Gy/min (1–20 fractions)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.75 Gy (2F, 9–12 Gy/F)D0 = 2.23 Gy (3F, 6.25–9 Gy/F)D0 = 2.83 Gy (5F, 4.2–6.3 Gy/F)D0 = 3.34 Gy (10F, 2.8–4.4 Gy/F)D0 = 4.21 Gy (15F, 1.9–3.2 Gy/F)D0 = 4.05 Gy (20F, 1.55–2.55 Gy/F)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.42 Gy (13.4–19.2 Gy)[125]Mouse(C3Hf/Bu)Female8–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Con, 50 MeVn, 16 MeV~ 1 Gy/min (20 fractions)0.8–0.9 Gy/min (1–5 fractions)0.25 Gy/min (1–5 fractions)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.06 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 2F, 3.5–5 Gy/F)D0 = 1.08 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 3F, 2.3–3.5 Gy/F)D0 = 1.23 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 5F, 1.35–2.25 Gy/F)D0 = 0.85 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 2F, 2.5–4 Gy/F)D0 = 0.72 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 3F, 1.7–3.3 Gy/F)D0 = 0.87 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 5F, 0.9–1.9 Gy/F)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 0.93 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 6.5–10 Gy)D0 = 0.81 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 4–10 Gy)[136]Mouse(BALB/c, C.B-17/scid)10–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co16, 600 mGy/minCrypt cell survivalscidα = 0.74 ± 0.07 (Gy−1)BALB/cα = 0.22 ± 0.02Crypt cell survivalscidα/β = 4.9 ± 4.5 (α = 0.50 ± 0.24 (Gy−1), β = 0.10 ± 0.05 (Gy−2))BALB/cα/β = 4.3 ± 4.7 (α = 0.14 ± 0.11 (Gy−1), β = 0.032 ± 0.010 (Gy−2))[127]Mouse(FVB/atm KO)Whole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0–40 Gy (17 mGy/min (= 1 Gy/h))Crypt cell survivalatm KOα = 0.60 ± 0.10 (Gy−1)FVBα = 0.17 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)-[128]Mouse(129Sv/C57BL/6/Trp53 KO, C57BL/6/bcl-2 KO, B6D2F1)10–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0–45 Gy (17 mGy/min (= 1 Gy/h))Crypt cell survivalTrp53+/+α = 0.13 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)Trp53+/−α = 0.090 ± 0.010 (Gy−1)Trp53−/−α = 0.031 ± 0.007 (Gy−1)Bcl-2+/+α = 0.14 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)Bcl-2+/−α = 0.19 ± 0.03 (Gy−1)Bcl-2−/−α = 0.19 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)B6D2F1α = 0.15 ± 0.01 (Gy−1)-[129]Mouse(Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 × ROSA26-LSL-LacZ)1 MWhole bodyStem cell replacement (Lgr5 lineage tracing)X, 260 kVpγ, 137Cs1 Gy (0.5 Gy/min)1 Gy (0.05 mGy/min)Colonic LacZ+ crypts (%)2.05 ± 0.79 (Sham)1.78 ± 0.73 (1 Gy, 0.05 mGy/min)Colonic LacZ+ crypts (%)1.98 ± 0.55 (Sham)1.40 ± 0.06 (1 Gy, 0.5Gy/min)[130]

eincidence of apoptotic bodies in crypt section [123]. KO, knockout.In the rat stomach, localized 300 kV X-irradiation with single and fractionated (two and five fractions given daily and in 4 weeks, which was called as subchronic exposure) doses was reported [122]. Between 4 and 40 weeks after irradiation subchronic radiation damage was observed which presented itself as atonic dilatation of the stomach, with a α/β value range of 4.8–5.3 Gy. In the five-fraction experiment a significant increase in tolerance amounting to 800 mGy/day for the acute effect and 400 mGy/day for the subchronic effect was observed when intervals were increased from 1 day to 1 week.In the mouse small intestine, induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min [123]. Some P4 stem cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by radiation at doses as low as 100 mGy. The lack of a dose-rate effect may be due to the dose-rate used being so high that all of the stem cells were uniformly irradiated. However, these results suggest that during chronic irradiation, continuous deletion of damaged cells and their replacement may occur [88]. On the other hand, the fractionation effect of jejunal crypt survival after fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) of C3H mice given at 1.2 Gy/min was more valid than at 80 mGy/min [124]. The α/β value calculated by using linear-quadratic model was 13.3 Gy at 1.2 Gy/min and 96 Gy at 80 mGy/min, respectively. Recovery of cell survival by multifractionated irradiation with γ-rays was also reported in mouse (C3Hf/Bu) jejunal and colonic crypts [125, 126].Under low dose-rate irradiation condition, any repair occur during irradiation, and therefore the extrapolation of the near-exponential portion of the crypt survival curve to zero dose, which was called back-extrapolation, could represent the pre-irradiation number of clonogens per crypt (clonogens were defined as cells that grow clonally). Additionally, the low dose-rate slope of the near-exponential portion could represent the αcomponent of a conventional linear-quadratic type survival curve [112]. In the scid mice having mutations on the Prkdc (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; DNA-PKcs), the α value was 0.74 ± 0.07 Gy−1, compared to 0.22 ± 0.02 Gy−1 in the parental Balb/c mice, indicating that scid mice are ~3-fold more sensitive and the back-extrapolation was similar in both cases at a common value of 20 ± 6 [112, 127]. Therefore, clonogen radiosensitivity was increased about 3-fold higher by scid mutation, although the clonogen content per crypt was not different. Similar results were also obtained in the study using atm knockout mice [128]. In the Atm−/− mice, the back-extrapolation was 12 ± 6, and α = 0.60 ± 0.10 Gy−1, compared to 13 ± 6 and α = 0.17 ± 0.02 Gy−1 in the parental wild-type FVB mice [112, 128]. Crypt survival in small intestine was also investigated using Trp53 and Bcl-2 knockout mice at 0.017 Gy/min (1 Gy/h) of 60Co γ-rays [129]. Crypt survival levels were higher in Trp53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy, but not after lower or higher doses. Similarly, crypt survival in Bcl2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl2+/+ and Bcl2+/− mice. These results suggest that the degree of curvature of the dose–response curve at a high dose-rate levels for some genotypes is not expected at lower dose-rate.Lgr5+ stem cells in the mouse colon were much more radiosensitive than those in duodenum, because the number of colonic Lgr5+ stem cells decreased significantly after exposure to high dose-rate (0.5 Gy/min) X-rays at a dose 1 Gy [121]. Therefore, using the Lgr5-lineage tracing technique, the effects of low dose-rate (0.05 mGy/min) γ-rays on the replenishment of colonic Lgr5+ stem cells could be measured [130]. Unlike high dose-rate irradiation, which significantly promoted replenishment of Lgr5+ stem cells, no significant acceleration of stem cell replenishment was observed upon low-dose-rate irradiation. 
Possible ‘key events’ related to dose rate effect in the digestive system Key events of the AOP related to the dose-rate effect, especially under low dose-rate irradiation condition, are not completely clear for the tissues/organs including digestive system. Therefore, the key events described below were mainly obtained by the studies using high dose and high dose-rate radiations. Importantly, a few recent studies have suggested that stem cell competition is one of the most important key events of the dose-rate effect in the intestine. For example, using stem cell-derived organoid culture system, irradiation at low dose-rates was shown to more efficiently eliminate damaged cells. Thus, the stem cell competition could provide a mechanism underlying the sparing effect of low-dose-rate irradiation [90]. 
DNA damage responses. The kinetics of 53BP1 foci formation, a surrogate marker for DSBs, has been studied in the mouse small intestine (duodenum and ileum) and colon irradiated with high dose-rate X-rays at doses 0.1, 1 or 4 Gy [131]. In the small intestine and colon, 53BP1 foci were similarly detected immediately after irradiation, but rapidly disappeared thereafter, especially noticeably in Lgr5+ stem cells. In contrast, the colon was more susceptible to radiation-induced formation of 53BP1 foci. Additionally, the formation of γ-H2AX, BRCA1, RAD51 and phospho-DNA-PKcs at T2609 foci was studied in the mouse small intestinal CBC cells [132]. CBCs are relatively radioresistant, repairing DNA by HR significantly more efficiently than transit amplifying progenitors or villus cells. On the other hand, radiosensitivity of intestinal clonogens was increased in the Prkdc-mutated scid mice and Atm knockout mice [112, 127, 128]. The DNA repair kinetics is also different between CBCs and the Lgr5+ mouse colonic epithelial stem cells (CESCs). After 19 Gy of whole body irradiation with high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) of γ-rays, CBCs and CESCs resolved γ-H2AX foci at different rates with CBCs repairing DSBs more slowly, a difference that persisted until at least 18 h after irradiation, a time at which CESCs had fully recovered [133]. 
Intracellular signaling. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcriptional regulator of genes encoding antioxidant and anti-inflammation enzymes that binds to its endogenous inhibitor protein, Kelch-like ECH (erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology)-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1), in the cytoplasm. Upon irradiation, Nrf2 is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to induce transcription of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and other cytoprotective enzymes through binding to antioxidant responsive elements. Mice fed with 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO)-ethyl amide (EA), which is the chemically modified derivative of the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO showed resistance to TBI at a dose of 7.5 Gy. Mice fed with CDDO-EA were also greatly protected from TBI-induced reduction in crypt size, number, cell density and villus length in both the colon and small intestine as well as the induction of apoptosis in colonic crypts [134]. Also, studies showing the importance of intracellular redox potential of glutathione in cell proliferation, cellular differentiation and cell death by apoptosis in intestinal epithelium were precisely reviewed [135], but its contribution to the dose-rate effect has not yet been well cleared. 
Gene expression. The expression levels of Trp53 and Cdkn1a (p21) increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in mouse small and large intestine after 8 Gy of high dose-rate irradiation with 137Cs γ-rays (3.8 Gy/min) [136]. In the small intestine, both Trp53 and Cdkn1a expressions were observed throughout crypts with the greatest frequency of expression over the first 15 cell positions, which includes the stem cell population (positions 3 to 5 and their vicinity) and the proliferating, transit cell population (positions 5 to 15 and their vicinity). Interestingly, cells expressing Trp53 were primarily distributed toward the crypt base. Subdivision of the Trp53-positive cell population revealed that the cells with the strongest Trp53 immunoreactivity were positioned farther toward the crypt base, and their distribution was almost coincident with the frequency distribution of apoptotic cells. Cells that were either weakly or moderately immunoreactive for Trp53 were located toward the middle of the crypt and were nearly coincident with the distribution of Cdkn1a. In the large intestine, Trp53 and Cdkn1a were observed along the entire length of the colonic crypts, and, unlike in the small intestine, this expression was not only maintained but increased over 72 h. The expression of Cdkn1a was detected in the colonic epithelium up to 6 days after irradiation. The expression of Cdkn1a could not be clearly detected 4 h after irradiation at a dose of 0.3 Gy in both small and large intestine. Meanwhile, after 1 Gy of high dose-rate (1.5 Gy/min) X-irradiation, the expression levels of Cdkn1a (p21) and Mdm2 increased significantly in the colon, but not in the duodenum, suggesting that the p53-dependent DNA damage response preferentially occurs in the colon, while the expression of Bax increased significantly in both organs [121]. 
Cell cycle regulation. In crypts of the mouse small and large intestine, irradiation with 8 Gy of 137Cs γ-rays (3.8 Gy/min) severely reduced thymidine incorporation [136]. The incorporation of thymidine was gradually recovered, however, it returned to the normal level by 72 h after irradiation. Cells re-entering the cell cycle (i.e. thymidine-labeled cells) were observed at a lower position in the crypts. Also, preferential cell loss in the lower crypt was observed in mouse colon irradiated with X-rays at a high dose rate (0.5 Gy/min) [131]. Considerable reduction of cell numbers and dramatic induction of mitosis were observed after low-dose (0.1 Gy) X-irradiation in the colon but not in the small intestine. In a study of using the 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining method, small intestinal CBCs began cycling 12 h after 19 Gy of whole-body irradiation at a high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays and by 15 h, maximal division was reinstituted [133]. Interestingly, it was estimated that about 60% of the small intestinal CBCs have not completed DNA repair at the time cell division reinitiates [133]. On the contrary, mouse CESCs began to exit growth arrest at 24 h after irradiation, and recovered their cycling levels by 48 h [133]. The kinetics of γ-H2AX indicated that DSBs were repaired by 18 h, a time preceding the checkpoint recovery initiation. 
Cell death. In mouse stomach irradiated with 137Cs γ-rays (2.6 Gy/min), maximum numbers of apoptotic cells were observed in both antrum and corpus at 48 h after irradiation at doses greater than 12 Gy [140]. However, the number of apoptotic cells observed in the gastric epithelium was much lower than observed in the small intestine or colon after similar doses of radiation. The greatest numbers of apoptotic cells were observed at cell positions 5–6 in the antrum and cell positions 15–18 in the corpus.Radiation-induced apoptotic cell death in the intestine has already been thoroughly reviewed [107, 112]. In both duodenal and colonic crypts, caspase-3 positive cells were observed 6 h after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (1.5 Gy/min), and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected 24 h after irradiation. The frequency of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive crypts showed that the frequency of apoptotic cells in crypts increased after 1 Gy of X-irradiation in both duodenum and colon [121]. As described above, it was reported that induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min in the mouse small intestine [123]. Crypt survival levels were higher in p53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy [137], and crypt survival of Bcl-2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl-2+/+ and Bcl-2+/− mice [129]. Additionally, significant alteration in the expression level of 26 autophagy and 17 oxidative stress-related genes was induced in the mouse jejunal-ileal region of the small intestine after exposure to 2 Gy of high dose-rate γ-rays (700 mGy/min) [138]. Immunoprobing of intestinal sections showed decreased autophagosome marker LC3-II in the intestinal epithelial cells after irradiation. The mitotic catastrophe in the small intestinal crypts was 8 times higher than in the colonic crypts at 48 h after 19 Gy of whole-body irradiation at a high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays [133]. 
Intercellular signaling. Many kinds of modifiers of gastrointestinal toxicity mediated by radiation, including interleukins, growth factors and cytokines, have been reported and reviewed by ICRP (2012) [107] and Hendry and Otsuka [112], however those mitigators are beyond the scope of this review. In the intestine, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for the renewal of the intestines [139]. Disruption of Wnt signaling led to an abrupt cessation of proliferation in intestinal crypts following unbated loss of intestinal tissue and often morbidity. Reciprocally, the Wnt co-agonist R-spondin could potently stimulate intestinal proliferation. Lgr5 is well known as one of the Wnt target genes. Although the negligible effect of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells loss during homeostasis [140], depletion of Lgr5+ cells during radiation (10 Gy)-induced damage and subsequent repair caused catastrophic crypt loss and deterioration of crypt-villus architecture [141]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also well known to act as the intercellular signaling molecules. As described above, alteration of oxidative stress-related genes, as well as autophagy-related genes, was induced in the mouse jejunal-ileal region of the small intestine after exposure to 2 Gy of high dose-rate γ-rays (0.7 Gy/min) [138]. Radiation exposure led to persistently increased oxidant production and decreased anti-oxidant gene expression leading to oxidative stress and activation of proliferative Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt)) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. 
Alteration of physiology and homeostasis. Chronic exposures at a dose rate of a few mGy per year indicate that every cell in the body will be hit by a track of radiation every few months. This then makes a hit stem cell, at any time, compete against surrounding non-hit stem cells with in a niche. ICRP (2015) [90] described that ‘if the elemental dose affects that stemness, the hit cells will be preferentially lost by competition from the tissue stem cell niche.’ And ‘Hence, stem cell competition at the tissue levels an ample possibility for a DREF value larger than unity, as in the case of the current DDREF value used by ICRP.’ Recently, the gene expression profiles of in the mouse colonic Lgr5+ stem cells, which were harvested by cell sorting at 2 weeks after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (0.5 Gy/min) or low dose-rate (0.05 mGy/min) γ-rays, were analyzed to identify key molecules that determine the dose-rate effects on the stem cell pool by RNA-sequence [142]. In the Lgr5+ stem cells irradiated with high dose-rate X-rays, pathways related to DNA damage response, cell growth, cell differentiation and cell death were upregulated. Interestingly, pathways related to apical junctions and extracellular signaling were upregulated in the colonic Lgr5+ stem cells irradiated with low dose-rate γ-rays. Apical junctions are known to play an important role in the exclusion of transformed cells that are surrounded by normal epithelial cells through ‘cell competition.’ Therefore, cell competition, through apical junctions and extracellular ligands, might contribute to the dose-rate effect on Lgr5+ cell replenishment.However, it is very difficult to evaluate radiation-induced stem cell competition under low dose-rate irradiation conditions in vivo. Recently, an organoid, having a crypt–villus-like structure [143], have been generated from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells at high efficiency in vitro. The intestinal organoid reflected the intestinal epithelium in vivo, because it contained all types of differentiated cells of the epithelium. The organoid-forming efficiency of irradiated cells relative to that of unirradiated controls could be defined as the surviving fraction of stem cells. Enzymatically dissociated single crypt cells from the duodenum and jejunum of mice were irradiated with 7.25, 29, 101, 304, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mGy of high dose-rate (100–470 mGy/min) X-rays immediately after plating, and the number of organoids was counted on day 12 [144]. A significant decrease in the surviving fraction of stem cells at approximately 1000 mGy. In a more recent study, Fujimichi et al. [145] established a two-color organoid culture system by mixing stem cells expressing different fluorescent colors. To analyze stem cell competition, two-color organoids were formed by mixing high dose-rate (0.5 Gy/min) X-irradiated and non-irradiated intestinal stem cells. In the two-color organoids, irradiated stem cells at a dose 1 Gy exhibited a growth disadvantage, although the organoid-forming potential (OFP) of the irradiated cells alone did not differ significantly from that of non-irradiated cells. This suggested that irradiated stem cells may become losers by the stem cell competition with non-irradiated cells, although more studies are needed to assess the effects of lower doses and lower dose-rates. 
Development of premalignant lesions. At 24 h after 19 Gy of whole body irradiation with high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays, mitotic cells in both the small and large intestines showed aberrant mitoses including anaphase bridges, multipolar spindles, misaligned chromosomes and chromosomal lagging [133]. Aberrant mitotic figures in small intestinal crypts were 8-fold higher than in large intestinal crypts. Additionally, in the study using Lgr5DTR mice, in which the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is knocked into the endogenous Lgr5 locus, the crypts, deficient for Lgr5+ cells, are competent to undergo hyperplasia upon loss of Apc [142]. It suggests that Lgr5− reserve intestinal stem cells are radiosensitive, and Lgr5+ cells are crucial for robust intestinal regeneration following radiation exposure, but are dispensable for premalignant hyperproliferation.

Summary of knowledge acquired from animal models of cancer development

Large scale animal experiments have defined the dose- and dose-rate-dependency of cancer induction, and more recently, mechanistic insights at the molecular levels, such as DNA damage induction, DNA damage repair and DNA damage response, which are the closely related issues to radiation carcinogenesis, are discussed in detail with respect to genomic instability and mutagenesis [61]. Thus, this section reviews dose-rate effects in animal experiments concerning bone marrow, mammary gland, digestive tract, lung and liver and discusses the possible underlying mechanisms with respect to AOP.

Mammary glandBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Epidemiological studies such as those on atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors have demonstrated that radiation exposure is its major risk factor, and increased risk related with radiation dose and the age at exposure [62]. 
Architecture, development and maintenance. The mammary gland is a tree of branching ducts, consisting of an outer layer of basal (myoepithelial) cells and inner layer of luminal cells (Fig. 3). Species differences does exist between rodents and humans in terms of architecture [63, 64]. In rodents, mammary ducts end in either terminal end buds ([TEB] sites of post-pubertal ductal elongation), terminal ducts and lobuloalveolus and the intra-lobular stroma is scanty (Fig. 3). In humans, mammary ducts end in the terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) with rich fibroblastic stroma. The human TDLU is a site at which breast cancer frequently develops and is considered as comparable to the lobuloalveolus and TEBs of rodents [63, 64]. In mice, the fetal gland consists of bipotent cells (i.e. capable of giving rise to basal and luminal lineages), which after birth turn into lineage-restricted basal and luminal progenitors that independently maintain the gland, with some controversial evidence has suggested the existence of long-term bipotent stem cells in adulthood [65]. In rodents, most of the mammary epithelial cells are produced during the post-pubertal development at TEB, which after maturation differentiate into either terminal ducts or lobuloalveolar buds in rodents [64]. Lobuloalveoli undergo extensive growth during pregnancy and lactation, and cessation of lactation induces their involution and remodeling in rodents, a change which is rather mild in human [65].Fig. 3Architecture of rodent mammary gland.Mammary epithelial cells undergo cyclic waves of proliferation and death in association with menstrual (~28 days, human) and estrous (4–5 days, mice and rats) cycles [66–68]. In both mice and rats, the progeny of proliferative cells, detected via intense labeling after a few weeks’ administration of bromodeoxyuridine, was found to steadily decrease with time and reach one tenth after ~2 months [69, 70], whereas in mice, basal and luminal progenitor cells continue to exist at least for 10 weeks [71, 72], indicating longer life of progenitor cells than differentiated cells. Life of mammary cells in human is not understood.As ovarian hormones direct development of mammary gland, they also play key roles in mammary carcinogenesis. Early menopause is associated with reduced breast cancer risk in women, and in both rodents and human, high radiation dose (over 2–5 Gy) to ovaries has been associated with early ovarian dysfunction and a reduction in radiation-associated breast cancer risk [73–75]. The effect on the ovary is lower at a low dose rate [76]. 
Dose-rate effect in radiation carcinogenesis. A series of experimental studies with rats and mice have been conducted. Data obtained from the comparison between the high dose-rate and low dose-rate exposure have provided rather conflicting results [77–88] (Table 3). It seems likely that dose-rate effects are affected by physiological factors. In fact, continuous administration of estrogen was reported to uncover dose-rate effects [83], consistent with the more recent finding that the dose-rate effect is more prominent in post-pubertal than peri-pubertal rats [76].Table 3Mammary carcinogenesis studies comparing the effects of acute and chronic exposuresI.FractionationSpecies (strain)RadiationEffect measureAcute exposure dose responseDose per fraction (interval time)Exposure periodTotal dose (Gy)Age when exposure startedEffect, fractionatedEffect, acute singleReferenceMouse (BALB/c)γ, 137Cs% with tumor (age-adjusted)Linear-quadratic10 mGy (1 d)50 mGy (1 d)25 d5 d0.2512 wk0.2%a9.7%12.3%[77]Rat (Sprague–‌Dawley)γ, 60CoIncrease in tumor no.Linear0.14–1.1 Gy (0.5 wk)2–16 wk4.46 wk3–6/103 MDb2–3/103 MD[78, 79]Rat (WAG/Rij)XTime to detectionNot analyzed0.2 Gy (1 mo)10 mo2.08 wk143 wkc139 wk[81]Rat (WAG/Rij)γ, 137CsExcess normalized riskLinear2.5–10 mGy (0.5 d)8–56 wk1 or 28 wk0.9–1.2/Gyd1.1/Gy[82, 84]Rat (WAG/Rij), estrogen-treatedγ, 137CsExcess normalized riskSigmoid2.5–40 mGy (0.5 d)2–56 wk1 or 28 wk0.6–2.4/Gyd7.7 at 1 Gye[83, 84]II.

Possible ‘key events’ related to the dose rate effect. As mentioned below, studies have analyzed tissue response of mammary gland to acute single irradiation at a high dose rate. Evidence on early key events in the AOP (Table 1) suggests induction of imbalance between basal and luminal cells as a result of their differential sensitivity to radiation [89], which may be more prominent at high acute doses, providing a possible basis for dose-rate effects. Regarding later key events, stimulation of long-term cell proliferation has been observed after acute radiation exposure, indicating hormonal and microenvironmental alterations. In fact, some microenvironmental changes show a switch-like dose response with a very low threshold, providing another mechanistic basis for the dose-rate effects. Early responses and later tissue kinetics after low dose-rate exposure, including the existence of radiation-induced cell competition [90], remain an open question. 
DNA damage responses. γH2AX foci are formed at 1 h, and mostly disappear by 4 h, after a single high-dose (2–6 Gy) irradiation in basal and luminal mammary cells of BALB/c mice, Sprague–Dawley rats and human tissue xenografts and the response is generally more prominent in luminal than basal cells [91–93], although these studies did not conclude whether this also holds true for TEBs and TDLU. γH2AX induction in luminal progenitor cells and mature cells is similar and dose dependent in rats [93]. Basal cells might have high non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity in BALB/c mice [92], although, controversially, they are prone to radiation-induced cell death as mentioned below. Focus formation of Rad51 was not detected in irradiated human mammary tissue xenograft, indicating a minor role for homologous recombination (HR) repair [91]. 
Intracellular signaling. Following the aforementioned initial responses to high dose radiation (2–5 Gy), Trp53 protein, which is a nuclear protein, is phosphorylated by nuclear kinases, such ATM and DNA-PK, in cells of the post-pubertal BALB/c mouse mammary ducts and human tissue xenografts after 1 h and is redistributed to cytoplasm in luminal cells at 4–6 h whereas it remains in the nucleus in basal cells [91, 94–96]. Trp53 may induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, the latter possibly being regulated in parallel by Brca2 [97]. 
Gene expression. Activation of Trp53 as mentioned above induces expression of Cdkn1a (p21) in BALB/c mouse mammary ducts and lobuloalveoli [96]. 
Cell cycle regulation. An acute high dose (2–5 Gy) irradiation drastically decreases incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in TEB of hybrid mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ strains and Sprague–Dawley rats by 6 h, indicating induction of S phase arrest [97, 98]. In BALB/c mice, most basal and luminal cells show reduced Ki67-positive fractions after acute 6 Gy irradiation, implying entrance to G0, while a subset of proliferative basal mammary cells exhibit G2 arrest [92]. In Sprague–Dawley rats, release from cell cycle arrest occurs in basal cells by 24 h, when luminal cells show longer arrest [93]. 
Cell death. An acute high dose (2–5 Gy) irradiation induces only moderate apoptosis in mammary glands of post-pubertal BALB/c mice, hybrid mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ strains and Sprague–Dawley rats [93–96]; this was Trp53-dependent in mice [96, 97] and observed also in adult BALB/c mice [98]. Apoptosis was more prominent in luminal than basal cells in BALB/c mice [92] and Sprague–Dawley rats [93]. At high doses (e.g. 4 Gy), reproductive cell death was more prominently induced in basal than luminal progenitor cells of Sprague–Dawley rats, whereas the effects were comparable at lower doses (e.g. 1 Gy) [93] (Fig. 4). In consistence, the percentage of basal cells decreased in BALB/c mice at 48 h after irradiation at 4 Gy [99]. Thus, importantly, acute high-dose exposure is more likely to induce imbalance between basal and luminal cells than chronic low-dose-rate exposure.Fig. 4Reproductive cell death of different mammary epithelial progenitors in rat mammary gland. Flow-sorted rat mammary epithelial cells were irradiated with γ-rays and colony formation was assessed. Adapted from Kudo et al. [93] (© 2023 Radiation Research Society). 
Intercellular signaling Evidence obtained with BALB/c mice suggests that activation of Trp53 after an acute high dose (5 Gy) exposure requires external TGFβ signaling activated by the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone [94, 95, 100]. Another line of evidence suggests stromal TGFβ is also required for various radiation-induced cancer-promoting effects, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, microenvironmental changes permissive for mammary stem cell activity and tumor formation and induction of stem cell-like status in epithelial cells (i.e. expression of both basal and luminal markers), all of which show a ‘switch-like’ (or all-or-none) dose response having a very low threshold below 100 mGy [101–103]. Such switch-like dose response can be a basis for dose rate effect. 
Alteration of physiology and homeostasis. Acute high dose exposure (2 Gy) induced increased cell proliferation in post-pubertal Sprague–Dawley rats and C57BL/6 J mice [104, 105]. In mice, this long-term effect was attributed to elevation of blood estrogen, activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and gene expression changes in the mammary epithelium [105, 106]. 
Development of premalignant lesions. Acute single irradiation at a high dose (2 Gy) induced hyperplastic changes in TEBs of the Sprague–Dawley rat mammary gland after 8 weeks [104].

Mammary gland

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Epidemiological studies such as those on atomic bomb (A-bomb) survivors have demonstrated that radiation exposure is its major risk factor, and increased risk related with radiation dose and the age at exposure [62].

Architecture, development and maintenance. The mammary gland is a tree of branching ducts, consisting of an outer layer of basal (myoepithelial) cells and inner layer of luminal cells (Fig. 3). Species differences does exist between rodents and humans in terms of architecture [63, 64]. In rodents, mammary ducts end in either terminal end buds ([TEB] sites of post-pubertal ductal elongation), terminal ducts and lobuloalveolus and the intra-lobular stroma is scanty (Fig. 3). In humans, mammary ducts end in the terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) with rich fibroblastic stroma. The human TDLU is a site at which breast cancer frequently develops and is considered as comparable to the lobuloalveolus and TEBs of rodents [63, 64]. In mice, the fetal gland consists of bipotent cells (i.e. capable of giving rise to basal and luminal lineages), which after birth turn into lineage-restricted basal and luminal progenitors that independently maintain the gland, with some controversial evidence has suggested the existence of long-term bipotent stem cells in adulthood [65]. In rodents, most of the mammary epithelial cells are produced during the post-pubertal development at TEB, which after maturation differentiate into either terminal ducts or lobuloalveolar buds in rodents [64]. Lobuloalveoli undergo extensive growth during pregnancy and lactation, and cessation of lactation induces their involution and remodeling in rodents, a change which is rather mild in human [65].Fig. 3Architecture of rodent mammary gland.Mammary epithelial cells undergo cyclic waves of proliferation and death in association with menstrual (~28 days, human) and estrous (4–5 days, mice and rats) cycles [66–68]. In both mice and rats, the progeny of proliferative cells, detected via intense labeling after a few weeks’ administration of bromodeoxyuridine, was found to steadily decrease with time and reach one tenth after ~2 months [69, 70], whereas in mice, basal and luminal progenitor cells continue to exist at least for 10 weeks [71, 72], indicating longer life of progenitor cells than differentiated cells. Life of mammary cells in human is not understood.As ovarian hormones direct development of mammary gland, they also play key roles in mammary carcinogenesis. Early menopause is associated with reduced breast cancer risk in women, and in both rodents and human, high radiation dose (over 2–5 Gy) to ovaries has been associated with early ovarian dysfunction and a reduction in radiation-associated breast cancer risk [73–75]. The effect on the ovary is lower at a low dose rate [76].

Dose-rate effect in radiation carcinogenesis. A series of experimental studies with rats and mice have been conducted. Data obtained from the comparison between the high dose-rate and low dose-rate exposure have provided rather conflicting results [77–88] (Table 3). It seems likely that dose-rate effects are affected by physiological factors. In fact, continuous administration of estrogen was reported to uncover dose-rate effects [83], consistent with the more recent finding that the dose-rate effect is more prominent in post-pubertal than peri-pubertal rats [76].Table 3Mammary carcinogenesis studies comparing the effects of acute and chronic exposuresI.FractionationSpecies (strain)RadiationEffect measureAcute exposure dose responseDose per fraction (interval time)Exposure periodTotal dose (Gy)Age when exposure startedEffect, fractionatedEffect, acute singleReferenceMouse (BALB/c)γ, 137Cs% with tumor (age-adjusted)Linear-quadratic10 mGy (1 d)50 mGy (1 d)25 d5 d0.2512 wk0.2%a9.7%12.3%[77]Rat (Sprague–‌Dawley)γ, 60CoIncrease in tumor no.Linear0.14–1.1 Gy (0.5 wk)2–16 wk4.46 wk3–6/103 MDb2–3/103 MD[78, 79]Rat (WAG/Rij)XTime to detectionNot analyzed0.2 Gy (1 mo)10 mo2.08 wk143 wkc139 wk[81]Rat (WAG/Rij)γ, 137CsExcess normalized riskLinear2.5–10 mGy (0.5 d)8–56 wk1 or 28 wk0.9–1.2/Gyd1.1/Gy[82, 84]Rat (WAG/Rij), estrogen-treatedγ, 137CsExcess normalized riskSigmoid2.5–40 mGy (0.5 d)2–56 wk1 or 28 wk0.6–2.4/Gyd7.7 at 1 Gye[83, 84]II.

Dose-rate effect in radiation carcinogenesis. A series of experimental studies with rats and mice have been conducted.

Possible ‘key events’ related to the dose rate effect. As mentioned below, studies have analyzed tissue response of mammary gland to acute single irradiation at a high dose rate. Evidence on early key events in the AOP (Table 1) suggests induction of imbalance between basal and luminal cells as a result of their differential sensitivity to radiation [89], which may be more prominent at high acute doses, providing a possible basis for dose-rate effects. Regarding later key events, stimulation of long-term cell proliferation has been observed after acute radiation exposure, indicating hormonal and microenvironmental alterations. In fact, some microenvironmental changes show a switch-like dose response with a very low threshold, providing another mechanistic basis for the dose-rate effects. Early responses and later tissue kinetics after low dose-rate exposure, including the existence of radiation-induced cell competition [90], remain an open question.

DNA damage responses. γH2AX foci are formed at 1 h, and mostly disappear by 4 h, after a single high-dose (2–6 Gy) irradiation in basal and luminal mammary cells of BALB/c mice, Sprague–Dawley rats and human tissue xenografts and the response is generally more prominent in luminal than basal cells [91–93], although these studies did not conclude whether this also holds true for TEBs and TDLU. γH2AX induction in luminal progenitor cells and mature cells is similar and dose dependent in rats [93]. Basal cells might have high non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity in BALB/c mice [92], although, controversially, they are prone to radiation-induced cell death as mentioned below. Focus formation of Rad51 was not detected in irradiated human mammary tissue xenograft, indicating a minor role for homologous recombination (HR) repair [91].

Intracellular signaling. Following the aforementioned initial responses to high dose radiation (2–5 Gy), Trp53 protein, which is a nuclear protein, is phosphorylated by nuclear kinases, such ATM and DNA-PK, in cells of the post-pubertal BALB/c mouse mammary ducts and human tissue xenografts after 1 h and is redistributed to cytoplasm in luminal cells at 4–6 h whereas it remains in the nucleus in basal cells [91, 94–96]. Trp53 may induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, the latter possibly being regulated in parallel by Brca2 [97].

Cell cycle regulation. An acute high dose (2–5 Gy) irradiation drastically decreases incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in TEB of hybrid mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ strains and Sprague–Dawley rats by 6 h, indicating induction of S phase arrest [97, 98]. In BALB/c mice, most basal and luminal cells show reduced Ki67-positive fractions after acute 6 Gy irradiation, implying entrance to G0, while a subset of proliferative basal mammary cells exhibit G2 arrest [92]. In Sprague–Dawley rats, release from cell cycle arrest occurs in basal cells by 24 h, when luminal cells show longer arrest [93].

Cell death. An acute high dose (2–5 Gy) irradiation induces only moderate apoptosis in mammary glands of post-pubertal BALB/c mice, hybrid mice of C57BL/6 and BALB/cJ strains and Sprague–Dawley rats [93–96]; this was Trp53-dependent in mice [96, 97] and observed also in adult BALB/c mice [98]. Apoptosis was more prominent in luminal than basal cells in BALB/c mice [92] and Sprague–Dawley rats [93]. At high doses (e.g. 4 Gy), reproductive cell death was more prominently induced in basal than luminal progenitor cells of Sprague–Dawley rats, whereas the effects were comparable at lower doses (e.g. 1 Gy) [93] (Fig. 4). In consistence, the percentage of basal cells decreased in BALB/c mice at 48 h after irradiation at 4 Gy [99]. Thus, importantly, acute high-dose exposure is more likely to induce imbalance between basal and luminal cells than chronic low-dose-rate exposure.Fig. 4Reproductive cell death of different mammary epithelial progenitors in rat mammary gland.

Intercellular signaling Evidence obtained with BALB/c mice suggests that activation of Trp53 after an acute high dose (5 Gy) exposure requires external TGFβ signaling activated by the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone [94, 95, 100]. Another line of evidence suggests stromal TGFβ is also required for various radiation-induced cancer-promoting effects, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, microenvironmental changes permissive for mammary stem cell activity and tumor formation and induction of stem cell-like status in epithelial cells (i.e. expression of both basal and luminal markers), all of which show a ‘switch-like’ (or all-or-none) dose response having a very low threshold below 100 mGy [101–103]. Such switch-like dose response can be a basis for dose rate effect.

Alteration of physiology and homeostasis. Acute high dose exposure (2 Gy) induced increased cell proliferation in post-pubertal Sprague–Dawley rats and C57BL/6 J mice [104, 105]. In mice, this long-term effect was attributed to elevation of blood estrogen, activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and gene expression changes in the mammary epithelium [105, 106].

Digestive systemThe digestive system comprises organs that extend from the mouth to the anus covered by epithelial cells. These organs of the digestive system consist of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum), aerodigestive tract (oral cavity and pharynx), esophagus and anal canal [107]. There is sufficient evidence that ionizing radiation has a carcinogenic effect on the gastrointestinal tract in human [88]. The tissue weighting factors of colon and stomach is 0.12, and esophagus is 0.04 [4] whereas the risk of radiation-induced cancer of the mouth and small intestine is extremely smaller than in these organs, so they are included in remainder tissues. The difference in susceptibility to cancer between small and large intestine could suggest that region-dependent tissue metabolism could affect dose-rate-effects, although the animal experiments on the dose-rate effects on the gastrointestinal tract are limited. In this section, we mainly describe the dose-rate effects on small and large intestine, for which informative results have been reported from several animal experiments. 
Architecture, development and maintenance. General features of the digestive tract were well reviewed in ICRP 2012 [107]. Briefly, the stomach is a large muscular organ connecting the esophagus at the cardia and the small intestine at the pyloric sphincter in the gastrointestinal tract. The volume of the stomach was assumed to be 30 cm3 and 175 cm3 in human newborns and adults, respectively [108]. The gastric epithelium is a single layer of cells continuing with the basal layer of the stratified epithelium of the esophagus. Differentiated epithelial cells within gastric pits secrete hydrochloric acid, digestive enzymes and mucus [107]. In the mouse pyloric stomach, Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) was identified as a marker for self-renewing multipotent stem cells responsible for the long-term renewal of the gastric epithelium [109], as well as in the small and large intestine [110]. Recently, the membrane protein aquaporin 5 (AQP5) was identified as a marker that enriched for not only mouse but human adult pyloric stem cells [111]. AQP5+ stem cells exist in the pyloric gland bases. In addition, AQP5+ cells are source of gastric cancer, and AQP5+ tumor cells show ex vivo stemness.Structural and cellular features of the intestine have been thoroughly described in ICRP (2012) [107] and Hendry and Otsuka [112] (Fig. 5). Epithelial cells are continuingly generated from intestinal stem cells in the crypts, migrate upward along the crypt–villus axis and are eliminated by apoptosis at the tip of the villi, with a turnover time of 4–5 days in mice [113]. The cell-cycle time for the majority of proliferating cells may be of the order of 12–13 h, and the time for crypt stem cells is longer at approximately 24 h in mice [107]. The cell cycle time in the human intestine is in the order of 30 and 39 h for the colon and the rectum, respectively. The stem cell cycle in human colonic crypts is stated as approximately 36 h [112–114]. It was estimated that there are ~5 × 107 crypts in the small intestine in man [114]. The length of the small intestine is ~270 cm, the diameter is about 2 cm and the surface area is ~1620 cm2. Therefore, the crypt density is ~3 × 104 per cm2. Crypt density in the colon may be 2 × 104 per cm2 or even less. The human colon is ~110 cm long, the diameter is ~5 cm and the surface area is ~1650 cm2. Thus, there are <3 × 107 crypts in the large intestine in man [107, 112]. Recent studies indicated that approximately six functional stem cells at the very base of each colonic crypt in mice [115] and approximately seven stem cells in humans [116].Fig. 5Architecture of mouse intestine.Intestinal stem cells exist at the bottom of crypts. The small cycling cells between Paneth cells are known as crypt base columnar (CBC) cells [117], and the Lgr5 is one of the molecular markers for CBC cells. In the case of the intestinal crypts, Lgr5+ CBCs generate Wnt producing Paneth cells [110]. Lgr5+ CBCs in the crypt bottom are interspersed with Paneth cells supplying Wnt proteins to maintain adjacent Lgr5+ CBCs. Paneth cells thus constitute the niche for Lgr5+ stem cells in the small intestine [118]. The other various intestinal stem cell markers have been reported to indicate differences in the characteristics of stem cells, and this has been reviewed by Hendry and Otsuka [112]. Cells located at the 4th position from the crypt base (P4) in the small intestine are the quiescent stem cells expressing B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi1), homeodomain-only protein (Hopx), leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (Lrig1), and/or high level of sex determining region Y box 9 (Sox9high). In addition, very few quiescent stem cells that express extremely mouse telomerase reverse-transcriptase (mTert) are extremely resistant to a high dose (10 Gy) of radiation and can reconstitute all cell types in the small intestine [119]. On the other hand, Lgr5-positive stem cells are resistant to 1 Gy of irradiation but sensitive to 10 Gy [110]. Intermediate filament keratin-19 (Krt19)-positive and Lgr5-negative cells also have been identified as radioresistant stem cells located above P4 in both the small intestine and colon [120]. Also, the molecular markers of CBC cells have been identified including olfactomedin 4 (Olfm4), achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2), Sox9low, etc. in addition to Lgr5. Colorectal Lgr5-positive stem cells were more radiosensitive than small intestinal those [121]. 
Dose-rate effect. To discuss dose-rate effect accurately, informative data sets that have complete dose response information obtained for different dose rates are required. However, animal experiments of dose-rate effects on the gastrointestinal tract are limited (Table 4).Table 4Summary of animal studies comparing the effects of acute and chronic exposures on digestive tractSpecies (strain)Part of irradiationAnalysisRadiation sourceDose, dose rateEffect, continuous or fractionatedEffect, acute singleReferenceRat(Wistar)Female3–6 MEntire stomachSurvival, body weight, subchronic stomach dilatationX, 300 kVp10.7 and 21.3 Gy (single), 7.8–15.6 Gy (2 fractions), 3.6–9.9 Gy (5 fractions), 3 Gy/minSurvival225 days after 2F/24 ha142 days after 2F/4 weeksb231 days after 5F/4 daysc181 days after 5F/4 weeksdSubchronic stomach dilatation (ED50)23.0 Gy (2F/24 ha)20.3 Gy (2F/4 weeksb)29.5 Gy (5F/4 daysc)39.9 Gy (5F/4 weeksd)Survival70 days after irradiation Subchronic stomach dilatation (ED50)15.7 Gy[122]Mouse(B6D2F1)Male10–12 WWhole bodyApoptotic cell death in the cryptγ, 60Coγ, 137CsX, 300 kVpn, 14.7 MeVn, 600 MeV2.7, 5.3, 820 mGy/min4.5 Gy/min0.6 Gy/min2.5, 5, 250 mGy/min1, 3 mGy/minApoptotic cell deatheNo significant effect of dose-rate 2.7–4500 mGy/min (γ, 60Co or 137Cs)No significant effect of dose-rate 2.5–250 mGy/min (n, 14.7 MeV)[123]Mouse(C3H)Female9–10 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0.02, 0.08, 0.36, 1.2, 4 Gy/min (1–20 fractions)Crypt cell survivalα/β = 96 Gy (0.08 Gy/min)Crypt cell survivalα/β = 13.3 Gy (1.2 Gy/min)[124]Mouse(C3Hf/Bu)8–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 137Cs2.85 Gy/min (1–20 fractions)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.75 Gy (2F, 9–12 Gy/F)D0 = 2.23 Gy (3F, 6.25–9 Gy/F)D0 = 2.83 Gy (5F, 4.2–6.3 Gy/F)D0 = 3.34 Gy (10F, 2.8–4.4 Gy/F)D0 = 4.21 Gy (15F, 1.9–3.2 Gy/F)D0 = 4.05 Gy (20F, 1.55–2.55 Gy/F)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.42 Gy (13.4–19.2 Gy)[125]Mouse(C3Hf/Bu)Female8–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Con, 50 MeVn, 16 MeV~ 1 Gy/min (20 fractions)0.8–0.9 Gy/min (1–5 fractions)0.25 Gy/min (1–5 fractions)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.06 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 2F, 3.5–5 Gy/F)D0 = 1.08 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 3F, 2.3–3.5 Gy/F)D0 = 1.23 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 5F, 1.35–2.25 Gy/F)D0 = 0.85 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 2F, 2.5–4 Gy/F)D0 = 0.72 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 3F, 1.7–3.3 Gy/F)D0 = 0.87 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 5F, 0.9–1.9 Gy/F)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 0.93 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 6.5–10 Gy)D0 = 0.81 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 4–10 Gy)[136]Mouse(BALB/c, C.B-17/scid)10–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co16, 600 mGy/minCrypt cell survivalscidα = 0.74 ± 0.07 (Gy−1)BALB/cα = 0.22 ± 0.02Crypt cell survivalscidα/β = 4.9 ± 4.5 (α = 0.50 ± 0.24 (Gy−1), β = 0.10 ± 0.05 (Gy−2))BALB/cα/β = 4.3 ± 4.7 (α = 0.14 ± 0.11 (Gy−1), β = 0.032 ± 0.010 (Gy−2))[127]Mouse(FVB/atm KO)Whole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0–40 Gy (17 mGy/min (= 1 Gy/h))Crypt cell survivalatm KOα = 0.60 ± 0.10 (Gy−1)FVBα = 0.17 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)-[128]Mouse(129Sv/C57BL/6/Trp53 KO, C57BL/6/bcl-2 KO, B6D2F1)10–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0–45 Gy (17 mGy/min (= 1 Gy/h))Crypt cell survivalTrp53+/+α = 0.13 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)Trp53+/−α = 0.090 ± 0.010 (Gy−1)Trp53−/−α = 0.031 ± 0.007 (Gy−1)Bcl-2+/+α = 0.14 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)Bcl-2+/−α = 0.19 ± 0.03 (Gy−1)Bcl-2−/−α = 0.19 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)B6D2F1α = 0.15 ± 0.01 (Gy−1)-[129]Mouse(Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 × ROSA26-LSL-LacZ)1 MWhole bodyStem cell replacement (Lgr5 lineage tracing)X, 260 kVpγ, 137Cs1 Gy (0.5 Gy/min)1 Gy (0.05 mGy/min)Colonic LacZ+ crypts (%)2.05 ± 0.79 (Sham)1.78 ± 0.73 (1 Gy, 0.05 mGy/min)Colonic LacZ+ crypts (%)1.98 ± 0.55 (Sham)1.40 ± 0.06 (1 Gy, 0.5Gy/min)[130]

eincidence of apoptotic bodies in crypt section [123]. KO, knockout.In the rat stomach, localized 300 kV X-irradiation with single and fractionated (two and five fractions given daily and in 4 weeks, which was called as subchronic exposure) doses was reported [122]. Between 4 and 40 weeks after irradiation subchronic radiation damage was observed which presented itself as atonic dilatation of the stomach, with a α/β value range of 4.8–5.3 Gy. In the five-fraction experiment a significant increase in tolerance amounting to 800 mGy/day for the acute effect and 400 mGy/day for the subchronic effect was observed when intervals were increased from 1 day to 1 week.In the mouse small intestine, induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min [123]. Some P4 stem cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by radiation at doses as low as 100 mGy. The lack of a dose-rate effect may be due to the dose-rate used being so high that all of the stem cells were uniformly irradiated. However, these results suggest that during chronic irradiation, continuous deletion of damaged cells and their replacement may occur [88]. On the other hand, the fractionation effect of jejunal crypt survival after fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) of C3H mice given at 1.2 Gy/min was more valid than at 80 mGy/min [124]. The α/β value calculated by using linear-quadratic model was 13.3 Gy at 1.2 Gy/min and 96 Gy at 80 mGy/min, respectively. Recovery of cell survival by multifractionated irradiation with γ-rays was also reported in mouse (C3Hf/Bu) jejunal and colonic crypts [125, 126].Under low dose-rate irradiation condition, any repair occur during irradiation, and therefore the extrapolation of the near-exponential portion of the crypt survival curve to zero dose, which was called back-extrapolation, could represent the pre-irradiation number of clonogens per crypt (clonogens were defined as cells that grow clonally). Additionally, the low dose-rate slope of the near-exponential portion could represent the αcomponent of a conventional linear-quadratic type survival curve [112]. In the scid mice having mutations on the Prkdc (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; DNA-PKcs), the α value was 0.74 ± 0.07 Gy−1, compared to 0.22 ± 0.02 Gy−1 in the parental Balb/c mice, indicating that scid mice are ~3-fold more sensitive and the back-extrapolation was similar in both cases at a common value of 20 ± 6 [112, 127]. Therefore, clonogen radiosensitivity was increased about 3-fold higher by scid mutation, although the clonogen content per crypt was not different. Similar results were also obtained in the study using atm knockout mice [128]. In the Atm−/− mice, the back-extrapolation was 12 ± 6, and α = 0.60 ± 0.10 Gy−1, compared to 13 ± 6 and α = 0.17 ± 0.02 Gy−1 in the parental wild-type FVB mice [112, 128]. Crypt survival in small intestine was also investigated using Trp53 and Bcl-2 knockout mice at 0.017 Gy/min (1 Gy/h) of 60Co γ-rays [129]. Crypt survival levels were higher in Trp53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy, but not after lower or higher doses. Similarly, crypt survival in Bcl2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl2+/+ and Bcl2+/− mice. These results suggest that the degree of curvature of the dose–response curve at a high dose-rate levels for some genotypes is not expected at lower dose-rate.Lgr5+ stem cells in the mouse colon were much more radiosensitive than those in duodenum, because the number of colonic Lgr5+ stem cells decreased significantly after exposure to high dose-rate (0.5 Gy/min) X-rays at a dose 1 Gy [121]. Therefore, using the Lgr5-lineage tracing technique, the effects of low dose-rate (0.05 mGy/min) γ-rays on the replenishment of colonic Lgr5+ stem cells could be measured [130]. Unlike high dose-rate irradiation, which significantly promoted replenishment of Lgr5+ stem cells, no significant acceleration of stem cell replenishment was observed upon low-dose-rate irradiation. 
Possible ‘key events’ related to dose rate effect in the digestive system Key events of the AOP related to the dose-rate effect, especially under low dose-rate irradiation condition, are not completely clear for the tissues/organs including digestive system. Therefore, the key events described below were mainly obtained by the studies using high dose and high dose-rate radiations. Importantly, a few recent studies have suggested that stem cell competition is one of the most important key events of the dose-rate effect in the intestine. For example, using stem cell-derived organoid culture system, irradiation at low dose-rates was shown to more efficiently eliminate damaged cells. Thus, the stem cell competition could provide a mechanism underlying the sparing effect of low-dose-rate irradiation [90]. 
DNA damage responses. The kinetics of 53BP1 foci formation, a surrogate marker for DSBs, has been studied in the mouse small intestine (duodenum and ileum) and colon irradiated with high dose-rate X-rays at doses 0.1, 1 or 4 Gy [131]. In the small intestine and colon, 53BP1 foci were similarly detected immediately after irradiation, but rapidly disappeared thereafter, especially noticeably in Lgr5+ stem cells. In contrast, the colon was more susceptible to radiation-induced formation of 53BP1 foci. Additionally, the formation of γ-H2AX, BRCA1, RAD51 and phospho-DNA-PKcs at T2609 foci was studied in the mouse small intestinal CBC cells [132]. CBCs are relatively radioresistant, repairing DNA by HR significantly more efficiently than transit amplifying progenitors or villus cells. On the other hand, radiosensitivity of intestinal clonogens was increased in the Prkdc-mutated scid mice and Atm knockout mice [112, 127, 128]. The DNA repair kinetics is also different between CBCs and the Lgr5+ mouse colonic epithelial stem cells (CESCs). After 19 Gy of whole body irradiation with high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) of γ-rays, CBCs and CESCs resolved γ-H2AX foci at different rates with CBCs repairing DSBs more slowly, a difference that persisted until at least 18 h after irradiation, a time at which CESCs had fully recovered [133]. 
Intracellular signaling. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcriptional regulator of genes encoding antioxidant and anti-inflammation enzymes that binds to its endogenous inhibitor protein, Kelch-like ECH (erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology)-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1), in the cytoplasm. Upon irradiation, Nrf2 is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to induce transcription of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and other cytoprotective enzymes through binding to antioxidant responsive elements. Mice fed with 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO)-ethyl amide (EA), which is the chemically modified derivative of the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO showed resistance to TBI at a dose of 7.5 Gy. Mice fed with CDDO-EA were also greatly protected from TBI-induced reduction in crypt size, number, cell density and villus length in both the colon and small intestine as well as the induction of apoptosis in colonic crypts [134]. Also, studies showing the importance of intracellular redox potential of glutathione in cell proliferation, cellular differentiation and cell death by apoptosis in intestinal epithelium were precisely reviewed [135], but its contribution to the dose-rate effect has not yet been well cleared. 
Gene expression. The expression levels of Trp53 and Cdkn1a (p21) increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in mouse small and large intestine after 8 Gy of high dose-rate irradiation with 137Cs γ-rays (3.8 Gy/min) [136]. In the small intestine, both Trp53 and Cdkn1a expressions were observed throughout crypts with the greatest frequency of expression over the first 15 cell positions, which includes the stem cell population (positions 3 to 5 and their vicinity) and the proliferating, transit cell population (positions 5 to 15 and their vicinity). Interestingly, cells expressing Trp53 were primarily distributed toward the crypt base. Subdivision of the Trp53-positive cell population revealed that the cells with the strongest Trp53 immunoreactivity were positioned farther toward the crypt base, and their distribution was almost coincident with the frequency distribution of apoptotic cells. Cells that were either weakly or moderately immunoreactive for Trp53 were located toward the middle of the crypt and were nearly coincident with the distribution of Cdkn1a. In the large intestine, Trp53 and Cdkn1a were observed along the entire length of the colonic crypts, and, unlike in the small intestine, this expression was not only maintained but increased over 72 h. The expression of Cdkn1a was detected in the colonic epithelium up to 6 days after irradiation. The expression of Cdkn1a could not be clearly detected 4 h after irradiation at a dose of 0.3 Gy in both small and large intestine. Meanwhile, after 1 Gy of high dose-rate (1.5 Gy/min) X-irradiation, the expression levels of Cdkn1a (p21) and Mdm2 increased significantly in the colon, but not in the duodenum, suggesting that the p53-dependent DNA damage response preferentially occurs in the colon, while the expression of Bax increased significantly in both organs [121]. 
Cell cycle regulation. In crypts of the mouse small and large intestine, irradiation with 8 Gy of 137Cs γ-rays (3.8 Gy/min) severely reduced thymidine incorporation [136]. The incorporation of thymidine was gradually recovered, however, it returned to the normal level by 72 h after irradiation. Cells re-entering the cell cycle (i.e. thymidine-labeled cells) were observed at a lower position in the crypts. Also, preferential cell loss in the lower crypt was observed in mouse colon irradiated with X-rays at a high dose rate (0.5 Gy/min) [131]. Considerable reduction of cell numbers and dramatic induction of mitosis were observed after low-dose (0.1 Gy) X-irradiation in the colon but not in the small intestine. In a study of using the 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining method, small intestinal CBCs began cycling 12 h after 19 Gy of whole-body irradiation at a high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays and by 15 h, maximal division was reinstituted [133]. Interestingly, it was estimated that about 60% of the small intestinal CBCs have not completed DNA repair at the time cell division reinitiates [133]. On the contrary, mouse CESCs began to exit growth arrest at 24 h after irradiation, and recovered their cycling levels by 48 h [133]. The kinetics of γ-H2AX indicated that DSBs were repaired by 18 h, a time preceding the checkpoint recovery initiation. 
Cell death. In mouse stomach irradiated with 137Cs γ-rays (2.6 Gy/min), maximum numbers of apoptotic cells were observed in both antrum and corpus at 48 h after irradiation at doses greater than 12 Gy [140]. However, the number of apoptotic cells observed in the gastric epithelium was much lower than observed in the small intestine or colon after similar doses of radiation. The greatest numbers of apoptotic cells were observed at cell positions 5–6 in the antrum and cell positions 15–18 in the corpus.Radiation-induced apoptotic cell death in the intestine has already been thoroughly reviewed [107, 112]. In both duodenal and colonic crypts, caspase-3 positive cells were observed 6 h after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (1.5 Gy/min), and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected 24 h after irradiation. The frequency of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive crypts showed that the frequency of apoptotic cells in crypts increased after 1 Gy of X-irradiation in both duodenum and colon [121]. As described above, it was reported that induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min in the mouse small intestine [123]. Crypt survival levels were higher in p53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy [137], and crypt survival of Bcl-2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl-2+/+ and Bcl-2+/− mice [129]. Additionally, significant alteration in the expression level of 26 autophagy and 17 oxidative stress-related genes was induced in the mouse jejunal-ileal region of the small intestine after exposure to 2 Gy of high dose-rate γ-rays (700 mGy/min) [138]. Immunoprobing of intestinal sections showed decreased autophagosome marker LC3-II in the intestinal epithelial cells after irradiation. The mitotic catastrophe in the small intestinal crypts was 8 times higher than in the colonic crypts at 48 h after 19 Gy of whole-body irradiation at a high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays [133]. 
Intercellular signaling. Many kinds of modifiers of gastrointestinal toxicity mediated by radiation, including interleukins, growth factors and cytokines, have been reported and reviewed by ICRP (2012) [107] and Hendry and Otsuka [112], however those mitigators are beyond the scope of this review. In the intestine, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for the renewal of the intestines [139]. Disruption of Wnt signaling led to an abrupt cessation of proliferation in intestinal crypts following unbated loss of intestinal tissue and often morbidity. Reciprocally, the Wnt co-agonist R-spondin could potently stimulate intestinal proliferation. Lgr5 is well known as one of the Wnt target genes. Although the negligible effect of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells loss during homeostasis [140], depletion of Lgr5+ cells during radiation (10 Gy)-induced damage and subsequent repair caused catastrophic crypt loss and deterioration of crypt-villus architecture [141]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also well known to act as the intercellular signaling molecules. As described above, alteration of oxidative stress-related genes, as well as autophagy-related genes, was induced in the mouse jejunal-ileal region of the small intestine after exposure to 2 Gy of high dose-rate γ-rays (0.7 Gy/min) [138]. Radiation exposure led to persistently increased oxidant production and decreased anti-oxidant gene expression leading to oxidative stress and activation of proliferative Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt)) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. 
Alteration of physiology and homeostasis. Chronic exposures at a dose rate of a few mGy per year indicate that every cell in the body will be hit by a track of radiation every few months. This then makes a hit stem cell, at any time, compete against surrounding non-hit stem cells with in a niche. ICRP (2015) [90] described that ‘if the elemental dose affects that stemness, the hit cells will be preferentially lost by competition from the tissue stem cell niche.’ And ‘Hence, stem cell competition at the tissue levels an ample possibility for a DREF value larger than unity, as in the case of the current DDREF value used by ICRP.’ Recently, the gene expression profiles of in the mouse colonic Lgr5+ stem cells, which were harvested by cell sorting at 2 weeks after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (0.5 Gy/min) or low dose-rate (0.05 mGy/min) γ-rays, were analyzed to identify key molecules that determine the dose-rate effects on the stem cell pool by RNA-sequence [142]. In the Lgr5+ stem cells irradiated with high dose-rate X-rays, pathways related to DNA damage response, cell growth, cell differentiation and cell death were upregulated. Interestingly, pathways related to apical junctions and extracellular signaling were upregulated in the colonic Lgr5+ stem cells irradiated with low dose-rate γ-rays. Apical junctions are known to play an important role in the exclusion of transformed cells that are surrounded by normal epithelial cells through ‘cell competition.’ Therefore, cell competition, through apical junctions and extracellular ligands, might contribute to the dose-rate effect on Lgr5+ cell replenishment.However, it is very difficult to evaluate radiation-induced stem cell competition under low dose-rate irradiation conditions in vivo. Recently, an organoid, having a crypt–villus-like structure [143], have been generated from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells at high efficiency in vitro. The intestinal organoid reflected the intestinal epithelium in vivo, because it contained all types of differentiated cells of the epithelium. The organoid-forming efficiency of irradiated cells relative to that of unirradiated controls could be defined as the surviving fraction of stem cells. Enzymatically dissociated single crypt cells from the duodenum and jejunum of mice were irradiated with 7.25, 29, 101, 304, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mGy of high dose-rate (100–470 mGy/min) X-rays immediately after plating, and the number of organoids was counted on day 12 [144]. A significant decrease in the surviving fraction of stem cells at approximately 1000 mGy. In a more recent study, Fujimichi et al. [145] established a two-color organoid culture system by mixing stem cells expressing different fluorescent colors. To analyze stem cell competition, two-color organoids were formed by mixing high dose-rate (0.5 Gy/min) X-irradiated and non-irradiated intestinal stem cells. In the two-color organoids, irradiated stem cells at a dose 1 Gy exhibited a growth disadvantage, although the organoid-forming potential (OFP) of the irradiated cells alone did not differ significantly from that of non-irradiated cells. This suggested that irradiated stem cells may become losers by the stem cell competition with non-irradiated cells, although more studies are needed to assess the effects of lower doses and lower dose-rates. 
Development of premalignant lesions. At 24 h after 19 Gy of whole body irradiation with high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays, mitotic cells in both the small and large intestines showed aberrant mitoses including anaphase bridges, multipolar spindles, misaligned chromosomes and chromosomal lagging [133]. Aberrant mitotic figures in small intestinal crypts were 8-fold higher than in large intestinal crypts. Additionally, in the study using Lgr5DTR mice, in which the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is knocked into the endogenous Lgr5 locus, the crypts, deficient for Lgr5+ cells, are competent to undergo hyperplasia upon loss of Apc [142]. It suggests that Lgr5− reserve intestinal stem cells are radiosensitive, and Lgr5+ cells are crucial for robust intestinal regeneration following radiation exposure, but are dispensable for premalignant hyperproliferation.

Digestive system

The digestive system comprises organs that extend from the mouth to the anus covered by epithelial cells. These organs of the digestive system consist of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum), aerodigestive tract (oral cavity and pharynx), esophagus and anal canal [107]. There is sufficient evidence that ionizing radiation has a carcinogenic effect on the gastrointestinal tract in human [88]. The tissue weighting factors of colon and stomach is 0.12, and esophagus is 0.04 [4] whereas the risk of radiation-induced cancer of the mouth and small intestine is extremely smaller than in these organs, so they are included in remainder tissues. The difference in susceptibility to cancer between small and large intestine could suggest that region-dependent tissue metabolism could affect dose-rate-effects, although the animal experiments on the dose-rate effects on the gastrointestinal tract are limited. In this section, we mainly describe the dose-rate effects on small and large intestine, for which informative results have been reported from several animal experiments.

Architecture, development and maintenance. General features of the digestive tract were well reviewed in ICRP 2012 [107]. Briefly, the stomach is a large muscular organ connecting the esophagus at the cardia and the small intestine at the pyloric sphincter in the gastrointestinal tract. The volume of the stomach was assumed to be 30 cm3 and 175 cm3 in human newborns and adults, respectively [108]. The gastric epithelium is a single layer of cells continuing with the basal layer of the stratified epithelium of the esophagus. Differentiated epithelial cells within gastric pits secrete hydrochloric acid, digestive enzymes and mucus [107]. In the mouse pyloric stomach, Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) was identified as a marker for self-renewing multipotent stem cells responsible for the long-term renewal of the gastric epithelium [109], as well as in the small and large intestine [110]. Recently, the membrane protein aquaporin 5 (AQP5) was identified as a marker that enriched for not only mouse but human adult pyloric stem cells [111]. AQP5+ stem cells exist in the pyloric gland bases. In addition, AQP5+ cells are source of gastric cancer, and AQP5+ tumor cells show ex vivo stemness.Structural and cellular features of the intestine have been thoroughly described in ICRP (2012) [107] and Hendry and Otsuka [112] (Fig. 5). Epithelial cells are continuingly generated from intestinal stem cells in the crypts, migrate upward along the crypt–villus axis and are eliminated by apoptosis at the tip of the villi, with a turnover time of 4–5 days in mice [113]. The cell-cycle time for the majority of proliferating cells may be of the order of 12–13 h, and the time for crypt stem cells is longer at approximately 24 h in mice [107]. The cell cycle time in the human intestine is in the order of 30 and 39 h for the colon and the rectum, respectively. The stem cell cycle in human colonic crypts is stated as approximately 36 h [112–114]. It was estimated that there are ~5 × 107 crypts in the small intestine in man [114]. The length of the small intestine is ~270 cm, the diameter is about 2 cm and the surface area is ~1620 cm2. Therefore, the crypt density is ~3 × 104 per cm2. Crypt density in the colon may be 2 × 104 per cm2 or even less. The human colon is ~110 cm long, the diameter is ~5 cm and the surface area is ~1650 cm2. Thus, there are <3 × 107 crypts in the large intestine in man [107, 112]. Recent studies indicated that approximately six functional stem cells at the very base of each colonic crypt in mice [115] and approximately seven stem cells in humans [116].Fig. 5Architecture of mouse intestine.Intestinal stem cells exist at the bottom of crypts. The small cycling cells between Paneth cells are known as crypt base columnar (CBC) cells [117], and the Lgr5 is one of the molecular markers for CBC cells. In the case of the intestinal crypts, Lgr5+ CBCs generate Wnt producing Paneth cells [110]. Lgr5+ CBCs in the crypt bottom are interspersed with Paneth cells supplying Wnt proteins to maintain adjacent Lgr5+ CBCs. Paneth cells thus constitute the niche for Lgr5+ stem cells in the small intestine [118]. The other various intestinal stem cell markers have been reported to indicate differences in the characteristics of stem cells, and this has been reviewed by Hendry and Otsuka [112]. Cells located at the 4th position from the crypt base (P4) in the small intestine are the quiescent stem cells expressing B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi1), homeodomain-only protein (Hopx), leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains protein 1 (Lrig1), and/or high level of sex determining region Y box 9 (Sox9high). In addition, very few quiescent stem cells that express extremely mouse telomerase reverse-transcriptase (mTert) are extremely resistant to a high dose (10 Gy) of radiation and can reconstitute all cell types in the small intestine [119]. On the other hand, Lgr5-positive stem cells are resistant to 1 Gy of irradiation but sensitive to 10 Gy [110]. Intermediate filament keratin-19 (Krt19)-positive and Lgr5-negative cells also have been identified as radioresistant stem cells located above P4 in both the small intestine and colon [120]. Also, the molecular markers of CBC cells have been identified including olfactomedin 4 (Olfm4), achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2), Sox9low, etc. in addition to Lgr5. Colorectal Lgr5-positive stem cells were more radiosensitive than small intestinal those [121].

Architecture of mouse intestine.

Intestinal stem cells exist at the bottom of crypts. The small cycling cells between Paneth cells are known as crypt base columnar (CBC) cells [117], and the Lgr5 is one of the molecular markers for CBC cells. In the case of the intestinal crypts, Lgr5+ CBCs generate Wnt producing Paneth cells [110]. Lgr5+ CBCs in the crypt bottom are interspersed with Paneth cells supplying Wnt proteins to maintain adjacent Lgr5+ CBCs.

Also, the molecular markers of CBC cells have been identified including olfactomedin 4 (Olfm4), achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 2 (Ascl2), Sox9low, etc. in addition to Lgr5. Colorectal Lgr5-positive stem cells were more radiosensitive than small intestinal those [121].

Dose-rate effect. To discuss dose-rate effect accurately, informative data sets that have complete dose response information obtained for different dose rates are required. However, animal experiments of dose-rate effects on the gastrointestinal tract are limited (Table 4).Table 4Summary of animal studies comparing the effects of acute and chronic exposures on digestive tractSpecies (strain)Part of irradiationAnalysisRadiation sourceDose, dose rateEffect, continuous or fractionatedEffect, acute singleReferenceRat(Wistar)Female3–6 MEntire stomachSurvival, body weight, subchronic stomach dilatationX, 300 kVp10.7 and 21.3 Gy (single), 7.8–15.6 Gy (2 fractions), 3.6–9.9 Gy (5 fractions), 3 Gy/minSurvival225 days after 2F/24 ha142 days after 2F/4 weeksb231 days after 5F/4 daysc181 days after 5F/4 weeksdSubchronic stomach dilatation (ED50)23.0 Gy (2F/24 ha)20.3 Gy (2F/4 weeksb)29.5 Gy (5F/4 daysc)39.9 Gy (5F/4 weeksd)Survival70 days after irradiation Subchronic stomach dilatation (ED50)15.7 Gy[122]Mouse(B6D2F1)Male10–12 WWhole bodyApoptotic cell death in the cryptγ, 60Coγ, 137CsX, 300 kVpn, 14.7 MeVn, 600 MeV2.7, 5.3, 820 mGy/min4.5 Gy/min0.6 Gy/min2.5, 5, 250 mGy/min1, 3 mGy/minApoptotic cell deatheNo significant effect of dose-rate 2.7–4500 mGy/min (γ, 60Co or 137Cs)No significant effect of dose-rate 2.5–250 mGy/min (n, 14.7 MeV)[123]Mouse(C3H)Female9–10 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0.02, 0.08, 0.36, 1.2, 4 Gy/min (1–20 fractions)Crypt cell survivalα/β = 96 Gy (0.08 Gy/min)Crypt cell survivalα/β = 13.3 Gy (1.2 Gy/min)[124]Mouse(C3Hf/Bu)8–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 137Cs2.85 Gy/min (1–20 fractions)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.75 Gy (2F, 9–12 Gy/F)D0 = 2.23 Gy (3F, 6.25–9 Gy/F)D0 = 2.83 Gy (5F, 4.2–6.3 Gy/F)D0 = 3.34 Gy (10F, 2.8–4.4 Gy/F)D0 = 4.21 Gy (15F, 1.9–3.2 Gy/F)D0 = 4.05 Gy (20F, 1.55–2.55 Gy/F)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.42 Gy (13.4–19.2 Gy)[125]Mouse(C3Hf/Bu)Female8–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Con, 50 MeVn, 16 MeV~ 1 Gy/min (20 fractions)0.8–0.9 Gy/min (1–5 fractions)0.25 Gy/min (1–5 fractions)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 1.06 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 2F, 3.5–5 Gy/F)D0 = 1.08 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 3F, 2.3–3.5 Gy/F)D0 = 1.23 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 5F, 1.35–2.25 Gy/F)D0 = 0.85 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 2F, 2.5–4 Gy/F)D0 = 0.72 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 3F, 1.7–3.3 Gy/F)D0 = 0.87 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 5F, 0.9–1.9 Gy/F)Crypt cell survivalD0 = 0.93 Gy (n, 50 MeV, 6.5–10 Gy)D0 = 0.81 Gy (n, 16 MeV, 4–10 Gy)[136]Mouse(BALB/c, C.B-17/scid)10–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co16, 600 mGy/minCrypt cell survivalscidα = 0.74 ± 0.07 (Gy−1)BALB/cα = 0.22 ± 0.02Crypt cell survivalscidα/β = 4.9 ± 4.5 (α = 0.50 ± 0.24 (Gy−1), β = 0.10 ± 0.05 (Gy−2))BALB/cα/β = 4.3 ± 4.7 (α = 0.14 ± 0.11 (Gy−1), β = 0.032 ± 0.010 (Gy−2))[127]Mouse(FVB/atm KO)Whole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0–40 Gy (17 mGy/min (= 1 Gy/h))Crypt cell survivalatm KOα = 0.60 ± 0.10 (Gy−1)FVBα = 0.17 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)-[128]Mouse(129Sv/C57BL/6/Trp53 KO, C57BL/6/bcl-2 KO, B6D2F1)10–12 WWhole bodyCrypt cell survivalγ, 60Co0–45 Gy (17 mGy/min (= 1 Gy/h))Crypt cell survivalTrp53+/+α = 0.13 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)Trp53+/−α = 0.090 ± 0.010 (Gy−1)Trp53−/−α = 0.031 ± 0.007 (Gy−1)Bcl-2+/+α = 0.14 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)Bcl-2+/−α = 0.19 ± 0.03 (Gy−1)Bcl-2−/−α = 0.19 ± 0.02 (Gy−1)B6D2F1α = 0.15 ± 0.01 (Gy−1)-[129]Mouse(Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 × ROSA26-LSL-LacZ)1 MWhole bodyStem cell replacement (Lgr5 lineage tracing)X, 260 kVpγ, 137Cs1 Gy (0.5 Gy/min)1 Gy (0.05 mGy/min)Colonic LacZ+ crypts (%)2.05 ± 0.79 (Sham)1.78 ± 0.73 (1 Gy, 0.05 mGy/min)Colonic LacZ+ crypts (%)1.98 ± 0.55 (Sham)1.40 ± 0.06 (1 Gy, 0.5Gy/min)[130]

eincidence of apoptotic bodies in crypt section [123]. KO, knockout.In the rat stomach, localized 300 kV X-irradiation with single and fractionated (two and five fractions given daily and in 4 weeks, which was called as subchronic exposure) doses was reported [122]. Between 4 and 40 weeks after irradiation subchronic radiation damage was observed which presented itself as atonic dilatation of the stomach, with a α/β value range of 4.8–5.3 Gy. In the five-fraction experiment a significant increase in tolerance amounting to 800 mGy/day for the acute effect and 400 mGy/day for the subchronic effect was observed when intervals were increased from 1 day to 1 week.In the mouse small intestine, induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min [123]. Some P4 stem cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis induced by radiation at doses as low as 100 mGy. The lack of a dose-rate effect may be due to the dose-rate used being so high that all of the stem cells were uniformly irradiated. However, these results suggest that during chronic irradiation, continuous deletion of damaged cells and their replacement may occur [88]. On the other hand, the fractionation effect of jejunal crypt survival after fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) of C3H mice given at 1.2 Gy/min was more valid than at 80 mGy/min [124]. The α/β value calculated by using linear-quadratic model was 13.3 Gy at 1.2 Gy/min and 96 Gy at 80 mGy/min, respectively. Recovery of cell survival by multifractionated irradiation with γ-rays was also reported in mouse (C3Hf/Bu) jejunal and colonic crypts [125, 126].Under low dose-rate irradiation condition, any repair occur during irradiation, and therefore the extrapolation of the near-exponential portion of the crypt survival curve to zero dose, which was called back-extrapolation, could represent the pre-irradiation number of clonogens per crypt (clonogens were defined as cells that grow clonally). Additionally, the low dose-rate slope of the near-exponential portion could represent the αcomponent of a conventional linear-quadratic type survival curve [112]. In the scid mice having mutations on the Prkdc (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; DNA-PKcs), the α value was 0.74 ± 0.07 Gy−1, compared to 0.22 ± 0.02 Gy−1 in the parental Balb/c mice, indicating that scid mice are ~3-fold more sensitive and the back-extrapolation was similar in both cases at a common value of 20 ± 6 [112, 127]. Therefore, clonogen radiosensitivity was increased about 3-fold higher by scid mutation, although the clonogen content per crypt was not different. Similar results were also obtained in the study using atm knockout mice [128]. In the Atm−/− mice, the back-extrapolation was 12 ± 6, and α = 0.60 ± 0.10 Gy−1, compared to 13 ± 6 and α = 0.17 ± 0.02 Gy−1 in the parental wild-type FVB mice [112, 128]. Crypt survival in small intestine was also investigated using Trp53 and Bcl-2 knockout mice at 0.017 Gy/min (1 Gy/h) of 60Co γ-rays [129]. Crypt survival levels were higher in Trp53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy, but not after lower or higher doses. Similarly, crypt survival in Bcl2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl2+/+ and Bcl2+/− mice. These results suggest that the degree of curvature of the dose–response curve at a high dose-rate levels for some genotypes is not expected at lower dose-rate.Lgr5+ stem cells in the mouse colon were much more radiosensitive than those in duodenum, because the number of colonic Lgr5+ stem cells decreased significantly after exposure to high dose-rate (0.5 Gy/min) X-rays at a dose 1 Gy [121]. Therefore, using the Lgr5-lineage tracing technique, the effects of low dose-rate (0.05 mGy/min) γ-rays on the replenishment of colonic Lgr5+ stem cells could be measured [130]. Unlike high dose-rate irradiation, which significantly promoted replenishment of Lgr5+ stem cells, no significant acceleration of stem cell replenishment was observed upon low-dose-rate irradiation.

Possible ‘key events’ related to dose rate effect in the digestive system Key events of the AOP related to the dose-rate effect, especially under low dose-rate irradiation condition, are not completely clear for the tissues/organs including digestive system. Therefore, the key events described below were mainly obtained by the studies using high dose and high dose-rate radiations. Importantly, a few recent studies have suggested that stem cell competition is one of the most important key events of the dose-rate effect in the intestine. For example, using stem cell-derived organoid culture system, irradiation at low dose-rates was shown to more efficiently eliminate damaged cells. Thus, the stem cell competition could provide a mechanism underlying the sparing effect of low-dose-rate irradiation [90].

DNA damage responses. The kinetics of 53BP1 foci formation, a surrogate marker for DSBs, has been studied in the mouse small intestine (duodenum and ileum) and colon irradiated with high dose-rate X-rays at doses 0.1, 1 or 4 Gy [131]. In the small intestine and colon, 53BP1 foci were similarly detected immediately after irradiation, but rapidly disappeared thereafter, especially noticeably in Lgr5+ stem cells. In contrast, the colon was more susceptible to radiation-induced formation of 53BP1 foci. Additionally, the formation of γ-H2AX, BRCA1, RAD51 and phospho-DNA-PKcs at T2609 foci was studied in the mouse small intestinal CBC cells [132]. CBCs are relatively radioresistant, repairing DNA by HR significantly more efficiently than transit amplifying progenitors or villus cells. On the other hand, radiosensitivity of intestinal clonogens was increased in the Prkdc-mutated scid mice and Atm knockout mice [112, 127, 128]. The DNA repair kinetics is also different between CBCs and the Lgr5+ mouse colonic epithelial stem cells (CESCs). After 19 Gy of whole body irradiation with high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) of γ-rays, CBCs and CESCs resolved γ-H2AX foci at different rates with CBCs repairing DSBs more slowly, a difference that persisted until at least 18 h after irradiation, a time at which CESCs had fully recovered [133].

Intracellular signaling. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcriptional regulator of genes encoding antioxidant and anti-inflammation enzymes that binds to its endogenous inhibitor protein, Kelch-like ECH (erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology)-associated protein 1 (KEAP-1), in the cytoplasm. Upon irradiation, Nrf2 is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to induce transcription of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and other cytoprotective enzymes through binding to antioxidant responsive elements. Mice fed with 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO)-ethyl amide (EA), which is the chemically modified derivative of the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO showed resistance to TBI at a dose of 7.5 Gy. Mice fed with CDDO-EA were also greatly protected from TBI-induced reduction in crypt size, number, cell density and villus length in both the colon and small intestine as well as the induction of apoptosis in colonic crypts [134]. Also, studies showing the importance of intracellular redox potential of glutathione in cell proliferation, cellular differentiation and cell death by apoptosis in intestinal epithelium were precisely reviewed [135], but its contribution to the dose-rate effect has not yet been well cleared.

Gene expression. The expression levels of Trp53 and Cdkn1a (p21) increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in mouse small and large intestine after 8 Gy of high dose-rate irradiation with 137Cs γ-rays (3.8 Gy/min) [136]. In the small intestine, both Trp53 and Cdkn1a expressions were observed throughout crypts with the greatest frequency of expression over the first 15 cell positions, which includes the stem cell population (positions 3 to 5 and their vicinity) and the proliferating, transit cell population (positions 5 to 15 and their vicinity). Interestingly, cells expressing Trp53 were primarily distributed toward the crypt base. Subdivision of the Trp53-positive cell population revealed that the cells with the strongest Trp53 immunoreactivity were positioned farther toward the crypt base, and their distribution was almost coincident with the frequency distribution of apoptotic cells. Cells that were either weakly or moderately immunoreactive for Trp53 were located toward the middle of the crypt and were nearly coincident with the distribution of Cdkn1a. In the large intestine, Trp53 and Cdkn1a were observed along the entire length of the colonic crypts, and, unlike in the small intestine, this expression was not only maintained but increased over 72 h. The expression of Cdkn1a was detected in the colonic epithelium up to 6 days after irradiation. The expression of Cdkn1a could not be clearly detected 4 h after irradiation at a dose of 0.3 Gy in both small and large intestine. Meanwhile, after 1 Gy of high dose-rate (1.5 Gy/min) X-irradiation, the expression levels of Cdkn1a (p21) and Mdm2 increased significantly in the colon, but not in the duodenum, suggesting that the p53-dependent DNA damage response preferentially occurs in the colon, while the expression of Bax increased significantly in both organs [121].

Cell cycle regulation. In crypts of the mouse small and large intestine, irradiation with 8 Gy of 137Cs γ-rays (3.8 Gy/min) severely reduced thymidine incorporation [136]. The incorporation of thymidine was gradually recovered, however, it returned to the normal level by 72 h after irradiation. Cells re-entering the cell cycle (i.e. thymidine-labeled cells) were observed at a lower position in the crypts. Also, preferential cell loss in the lower crypt was observed in mouse colon irradiated with X-rays at a high dose rate (0.5 Gy/min) [131]. Considerable reduction of cell numbers and dramatic induction of mitosis were observed after low-dose (0.1 Gy) X-irradiation in the colon but not in the small intestine. In a study of using the 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining method, small intestinal CBCs began cycling 12 h after 19 Gy of whole-body irradiation at a high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays and by 15 h, maximal division was reinstituted [133]. Interestingly, it was estimated that about 60% of the small intestinal CBCs have not completed DNA repair at the time cell division reinitiates [133]. On the contrary, mouse CESCs began to exit growth arrest at 24 h after irradiation, and recovered their cycling levels by 48 h [133]. The kinetics of γ-H2AX indicated that DSBs were repaired by 18 h, a time preceding the checkpoint recovery initiation.

Cell death. In mouse stomach irradiated with 137Cs γ-rays (2.6 Gy/min), maximum numbers of apoptotic cells were observed in both antrum and corpus at 48 h after irradiation at doses greater than 12 Gy [140]. However, the number of apoptotic cells observed in the gastric epithelium was much lower than observed in the small intestine or colon after similar doses of radiation. The greatest numbers of apoptotic cells were observed at cell positions 5–6 in the antrum and cell positions 15–18 in the corpus.Radiation-induced apoptotic cell death in the intestine has already been thoroughly reviewed [107, 112]. In both duodenal and colonic crypts, caspase-3 positive cells were observed 6 h after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (1.5 Gy/min), and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected 24 h after irradiation. The frequency of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive crypts showed that the frequency of apoptotic cells in crypts increased after 1 Gy of X-irradiation in both duodenum and colon [121]. As described above, it was reported that induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min in the mouse small intestine [123]. Crypt survival levels were higher in p53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy [137], and crypt survival of Bcl-2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl-2+/+ and Bcl-2+/− mice [129]. Additionally, significant alteration in the expression level of 26 autophagy and 17 oxidative stress-related genes was induced in the mouse jejunal-ileal region of the small intestine after exposure to 2 Gy of high dose-rate γ-rays (700 mGy/min) [138]. Immunoprobing of intestinal sections showed decreased autophagosome marker LC3-II in the intestinal epithelial cells after irradiation. The mitotic catastrophe in the small intestinal crypts was 8 times higher than in the colonic crypts at 48 h after 19 Gy of whole-body irradiation at a high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays [133].

Cell death. In mouse stomach irradiated with 137Cs γ-rays (2.6 Gy/min), maximum numbers of apoptotic cells were observed in both antrum and corpus at 48 h after irradiation at doses greater than 12 Gy [140]. However, the number of apoptotic cells observed in the gastric epithelium was much lower than observed in the small intestine or colon after similar doses of radiation. The greatest numbers of apoptotic cells were observed at cell positions 5–6 in the antrum and cell positions 15–18 in the corpus.

Radiation-induced apoptotic cell death in the intestine has already been thoroughly reviewed [107, 112]. In both duodenal and colonic crypts, caspase-3 positive cells were observed 6 h after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (1.5 Gy/min), and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells were detected 24 h after irradiation. The frequency of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive crypts showed that the frequency of apoptotic cells in crypts increased after 1 Gy of X-irradiation in both duodenum and colon [121]. As described above, it was reported that induction of apoptotic cell death by low doses of γ-rays was independent of dose-rate between 0.0027 and 4.5 Gy/min in the mouse small intestine [123]. Crypt survival levels were higher in p53−/− mice than in Trp53+/+ and Trp53+/− mice after 25–30 Gy [137], and crypt survival of Bcl-2−/− mice was lower after all doses than Bcl-2+/+ and Bcl-2+/− mice [129].

Intercellular signaling. Many kinds of modifiers of gastrointestinal toxicity mediated by radiation, including interleukins, growth factors and cytokines, have been reported and reviewed by ICRP (2012) [107] and Hendry and Otsuka [112], however those mitigators are beyond the scope of this review. In the intestine, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for the renewal of the intestines [139]. Disruption of Wnt signaling led to an abrupt cessation of proliferation in intestinal crypts following unbated loss of intestinal tissue and often morbidity. Reciprocally, the Wnt co-agonist R-spondin could potently stimulate intestinal proliferation. Lgr5 is well known as one of the Wnt target genes. Although the negligible effect of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells loss during homeostasis [140], depletion of Lgr5+ cells during radiation (10 Gy)-induced damage and subsequent repair caused catastrophic crypt loss and deterioration of crypt-villus architecture [141]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also well known to act as the intercellular signaling molecules. As described above, alteration of oxidative stress-related genes, as well as autophagy-related genes, was induced in the mouse jejunal-ileal region of the small intestine after exposure to 2 Gy of high dose-rate γ-rays (0.7 Gy/min) [138]. Radiation exposure led to persistently increased oxidant production and decreased anti-oxidant gene expression leading to oxidative stress and activation of proliferative Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt)) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling.

Alteration of physiology and homeostasis. Chronic exposures at a dose rate of a few mGy per year indicate that every cell in the body will be hit by a track of radiation every few months. This then makes a hit stem cell, at any time, compete against surrounding non-hit stem cells with in a niche. ICRP (2015) [90] described that ‘if the elemental dose affects that stemness, the hit cells will be preferentially lost by competition from the tissue stem cell niche.’ And ‘Hence, stem cell competition at the tissue levels an ample possibility for a DREF value larger than unity, as in the case of the current DDREF value used by ICRP.’ Recently, the gene expression profiles of in the mouse colonic Lgr5+ stem cells, which were harvested by cell sorting at 2 weeks after exposure to 1 Gy of high dose-rate X-rays (0.5 Gy/min) or low dose-rate (0.05 mGy/min) γ-rays, were analyzed to identify key molecules that determine the dose-rate effects on the stem cell pool by RNA-sequence [142]. In the Lgr5+ stem cells irradiated with high dose-rate X-rays, pathways related to DNA damage response, cell growth, cell differentiation and cell death were upregulated. Interestingly, pathways related to apical junctions and extracellular signaling were upregulated in the colonic Lgr5+ stem cells irradiated with low dose-rate γ-rays. Apical junctions are known to play an important role in the exclusion of transformed cells that are surrounded by normal epithelial cells through ‘cell competition.’ Therefore, cell competition, through apical junctions and extracellular ligands, might contribute to the dose-rate effect on Lgr5+ cell replenishment.However, it is very difficult to evaluate radiation-induced stem cell competition under low dose-rate irradiation conditions in vivo. Recently, an organoid, having a crypt–villus-like structure [143], have been generated from Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells at high efficiency in vitro. The intestinal organoid reflected the intestinal epithelium in vivo, because it contained all types of differentiated cells of the epithelium. The organoid-forming efficiency of irradiated cells relative to that of unirradiated controls could be defined as the surviving fraction of stem cells. Enzymatically dissociated single crypt cells from the duodenum and jejunum of mice were irradiated with 7.25, 29, 101, 304, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mGy of high dose-rate (100–470 mGy/min) X-rays immediately after plating, and the number of organoids was counted on day 12 [144]. A significant decrease in the surviving fraction of stem cells at approximately 1000 mGy. In a more recent study, Fujimichi et al. [145] established a two-color organoid culture system by mixing stem cells expressing different fluorescent colors. To analyze stem cell competition, two-color organoids were formed by mixing high dose-rate (0.5 Gy/min) X-irradiated and non-irradiated intestinal stem cells. In the two-color organoids, irradiated stem cells at a dose 1 Gy exhibited a growth disadvantage, although the organoid-forming potential (OFP) of the irradiated cells alone did not differ significantly from that of non-irradiated cells. This suggested that irradiated stem cells may become losers by the stem cell competition with non-irradiated cells, although more studies are needed to assess the effects of lower doses and lower dose-rates.

Development of premalignant lesions. At 24 h after 19 Gy of whole body irradiation with high dose-rate (1.72 Gy/min) γ-rays, mitotic cells in both the small and large intestines showed aberrant mitoses including anaphase bridges, multipolar spindles, misaligned chromosomes and chromosomal lagging [133]. Aberrant mitotic figures in small intestinal crypts were 8-fold higher than in large intestinal crypts. Additionally, in the study using Lgr5DTR mice, in which the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is knocked into the endogenous Lgr5 locus, the crypts, deficient for Lgr5+ cells, are competent to undergo hyperplasia upon loss of Apc [142]. It suggests that Lgr5− reserve intestinal stem cells are radiosensitive, and Lgr5+ cells are crucial for robust intestinal regeneration following radiation exposure, but are dispensable for premalignant hyperproliferation.

SUMMARYThis review summarizes the studies on dose-rate effects and discusses the biological mechanisms underlying the effects. Although several in vitro and in vivo studies have been reviewed, information on dose-rate dependent DSB induction in animal experimental models is still limited. The review also outlined dose-rate effects and key events, which are often related to tissue/organ structure and tissue stem cells, for mammary gland and gastrointestinal tract, while the summary for another three tissue/organ, which are hematopoietic tissue, lung and liver, is provided in Part II.
