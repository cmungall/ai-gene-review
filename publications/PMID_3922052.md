The effect of nitroglycerin ointment (30 mg) and isosorbide dinitrate ointment 
(100 mg) versus placebo on exercise capacity has been investigated in 12 
patients. All had angina pectoris and coronary artery disease documented by 
coronary angiography. Nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate ointment produced a 
significant increase in exercise capacity, without any significant difference in 
the beneficial effect of the two. Stress-induced changes of the ST-segment in 
the electrocardiogram decreased by 65% after nitroglycerin ointment and by 41% 
after isosorbide dinitrate ointment, compared to placebo. These results indicate 
that nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate ointment reduce stress-induced 
myocardial ischemia at similar work loads.
