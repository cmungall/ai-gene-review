The recent abundance of genome sequence data has brought an urgent need for 
systematic proteomics to decipher the encoded protein networks that dictate 
cellular function. To date, generation of large-scale protein-protein 
interaction maps has relied on the yeast two-hybrid system, which detects binary 
interactions through activation of reporter gene expression. With the advent of 
ultrasensitive mass spectrometric protein identification methods, it is feasible 
to identify directly protein complexes on a proteome-wide scale. Here we report, 
using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case, an example of 
this approach, which we term high-throughput mass spectrometric protein complex 
identification (HMS-PCI). Beginning with 10% of predicted yeast proteins as 
baits, we detected 3,617 associated proteins covering 25% of the yeast proteome. 
Numerous protein complexes were identified, including many new interactions in 
various signalling pathways and in the DNA damage response. Comparison of the 
HMS-PCI data set with interactions reported in the literature revealed an 
average threefold higher success rate in detection of known complexes compared 
with large-scale two-hybrid studies. Given the high degree of connectivity 
observed in this study, even partial HMS-PCI coverage of complex proteomes, 
including that of humans, should allow comprehensive identification of cellular 
networks.

Introduction

Our mechanistic understanding of biology and disease is constrained by limited knowledge of genes’ functions and interplay. This process involves three major steps: sequencing the genome, identifying the genes, and functionally characterizing them. Thanks to advancements in omic techniques, major progress has been made on the former two steps: genomics has enabled a complete sequencing of the human genome in 2022,1 and the sequencing of about 500,000 other species.2 In parallel, next-generation RNA sequencing and modern proteomics can experimentally detect RNA-transcribed genes or protein-coding genes, scalably across tissues and species. For example, we officially recognize about 20,000 protein-coding and 20–40,000 non-coding genes in the human species (Table 1).

Whereas gene sequencing has grown exponentially since the late ‘90s, gene functional characterization has grown only linearly, as it still relies on gathering large amounts of non-scalable experimental investigations.2,3 Large biocurated repositories have been set up, harmonizing annotations in a controlled vocabulary.4,5 We may classify them in three domains:
Gene functions/properties, such as: molecular functions (GO6, InterPro7; Pfam8; UniProt9); biological processes (FunCat10; GO6); high/low expression in a certain tissue (Human Protein Atlas11); or cellular localizations (GO6, COMPARTMENTS,12 LOCATE,13 SynGo14).Disease involvement, such as: contributing to disease mechanism according to experimental literature (DisGeNET15; KEGG16; HuGE17; MSigDB18; RGD19); being genetically involved based on Mendelian inheritance (OMIM20); or being a candidate hit based on genetic association studies (PheGenI21, GAD22).Gene regulatory networks, such as: protein-protein interaction (BioGRID23; I2D24; IntAct25; iRefIndex26; MiNT27; MIPS28); phylogenetic similarity (STRING29); catalyzing successive reactions in a pathway (BioCarta30; ConsensusPathDB31; hiPathDB32; HIPPIE33; KEGG16; MSigDB18; Reactome34; RGD19; Wikipathways35); or functional annotations such as up/downregulation and biochemical modifications (KEGG16; Signor36).

Gene functions/properties, such as: molecular functions (GO6, InterPro7; Pfam8; UniProt9); biological processes (FunCat10; GO6); high/low expression in a certain tissue (Human Protein Atlas11); or cellular localizations (GO6, COMPARTMENTS,12 LOCATE,13 SynGo14).

Disease involvement, such as: contributing to disease mechanism according to experimental literature (DisGeNET15; KEGG16; HuGE17; MSigDB18; RGD19); being genetically involved based on Mendelian inheritance (OMIM20); or being a candidate hit based on genetic association studies (PheGenI21, GAD22).

Gene regulatory networks, such as: protein-protein interaction (BioGRID23; I2D24; IntAct25; iRefIndex26; MiNT27; MIPS28); phylogenetic similarity (STRING29); catalyzing successive reactions in a pathway (BioCarta30; ConsensusPathDB31; hiPathDB32; HIPPIE33; KEGG16; MSigDB18; Reactome34; RGD19; Wikipathways35); or functional annotations such as up/downregulation and biochemical modifications (KEGG16; Signor36).

A number of bioinformatic tools have been developed to predict gene annotation in silico across all three of these domains, namely gene function prediction (GFP, Table 2), gene disease prediction (GDP, Table 3) and gene network prediction (GNP, Table 4). They generally train their models based on gene annotations from the “highly annotated” organisms like H. sapiens. However, a major problem has been often overlooked: even the annotations in such model organisms are “literature-biased”, namely (i) dramatically incomplete, (ii) highly biased in favor of a subset of genes, and (iii) sometimes even erroneous.

Annotation reportedly suffers from reliability issues, being sourced from scientific publications. Reproducibility studies have consistently indicated that the majority of claims reported in literature are false.47 For example, a survey showed that only 1 in 4 pre-clinical papers are reproducible.48 This crisis has been attributed for the most part to research social structures.47,48

All this is relevant because, if one trains a GFP/GDP/GNP model based on literature-biased data, it is plausible that the predictions themselves may reflect literature bias, for example, favoring genes that have already been extensively studied as opposed to ghost genes. Conversely, if one trains a model on literature-agnostic data, performance may be numerically lower by machine learning (ML) metrics, but the absence of bias may make results more biologically “interesting”, i.e., more in line with the biological truth. This question has never been systematically studied, as most recent papers quantify their models’ performance merely based on ML scores, such as the ROC-AUC, while their training data were literature-biased in (almost) all the cases (see Table 2 and Table 3).

As a prime example, a majority of the recent models were trained on protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, under a probabilistic paradigm known as “guilt by association” (GBA, also known as linkage-based assumption)49: essentially, the annotation of a new protein likely reflects that of its PPI partners.50 For example, if a protein interacts with many cytoskeletal proteins, chances are it is itself a cytoskeletal protein. This assumption is biologically questionable, for multiple reasons. First, it was shown that the GBA-relevant PPI edges (i.e., edges which cause functionally related genes to be more interconnected) represent less than 0.01%, among millions of other irrelevant connections.51 Next, not all cell functions are mediated by physical interaction (second messengers, DNA binding, RNA interference, microRNA activity, pH regulation, membrane permeability…). Next, most reaction-relevant interactions happen at low affinity, as they are meant to be transient, implying they may not be detected by PPIs.50,52 Next, PPIs are obtained using a bait-prey system, where baits are chosen by investigators in the context of a specific experiment, causing them to be literature-biased, laboratory-biased,53 highly incomplete53,54 and inconsistent.55 Finally, and most importantly, today’s PPIs are a highly ambiguous category. Originally, PPIs started as experimentally derived physical binding partners (interactomics).56 Over the years, their definition has been expanded to a variety of “non-physical” PPIs, which are actually correlative in nature: thing like, sharing a similar expression pattern (coexpression interactions),57 sharing perturbation effects (genetic interactions),58 sharing orthology/paralogy patterns (phylogenetic interaction)29 or sharing similarities in literature coverage.59 Most of the GFP/GDP/GNP implementations have lost sight of the biology as they often feed large, catch-all PPI matrices into their model, without distinguishing between different interaction modalities (see Table 4).29

To overcome literature bias and incomplete biological granularity of existing GFP/GDP/GNP architectures, we introduce GhostBuster, a tool that combines state-of-the art deep learning with literature-unbiased data sources to predict novel annotations, with particular focus on ghost genes. We created two versions GhostBuster: (i) Tabular GhostBuster, which targets a provided lists of genes that are known to be involved in a given cell function or disease; it creates an implicit rule of what factors are shared among those lister genes, and prioritizes the other non-lister genes based on how closely they match such rule, for GFP/GDP purposes. Likewise, (ii) a Graph GhostBuster, which targets a provided list of gene pairs that interact in a given biological modality (say, phosphorylation), creates an implicit rule, and prioritizes the other non-lister gene pairs, for GNP purposes. As for the input information, we compared GhostBuster’s performance using five different input channels: three are literature-agnostic as they are experimentally derived, whereas two are literature-biased. We showed that, from a ML metric perspective, literature-biased channels generally outperform the unbiased ones. However, confounder analysis reveals that predictions from unbiased channels are more novel, unbiased, and biologically interesting. This suggests that ML metrics are not a reliable scoring system for GFP/GDP/GNP tasks, as they reward models for learning literature bias.

To the best of our knowledge, GhostBuster is the first modern ML architecture that makes GFP/GDP predictions in a completely literature-unbiased way, and the first GNP architecture that achieves biological mechanistic resolution. These features make it an ideal tool to study a ghost gene’s involvement in a given biological process or disease.

ResultsTarget dataset preparationIn Tabular GhostBuster, the target (Y) is a list of genes that are currently known to be involved in a specific “phenotype” of interest (a cell function, cell compartment or disease, say, “autophagy”); the prediction output is a prioritized gene list, based on how closely they match the common factors shared by all positive genes in the target list—i.e., a genome-wide ranking of genes, based on how likely they are to be involved in, say, autophagy. For the sake of validating Tabular GhostBuster, we repeated the training against 81 phenotypes (Supplementary Table 1), selected with the intent to cover biological fields of great scientific relevance. These 81 phenotypes include: 50 cell functions and 4 cell localization from Gene Ontology (GO) dataset41; 21 lists of genes involved in disease, taken from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)18; and 6 lists of gene hits from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), sourced from the Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI).21 Among the 81 target classes, we included three clusters that represent sub-mechanisms of the same biological processes, namely 8 classes of DNA damage response, 6 classes of autophagy and 9 classes of metabolism-related functions. A gene-centric t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plot of the 81 gene classes confirmed that they sample the entire “space” of cell biology in a fairly uniform way (Supplementary Figure 1).Conversely, in Graph GhostBuster, the target list is represented by a set of gene-gene pairs that interact by a specific biological modality (e.g., phosphorylation); the prediction output is a prioritized gene pair list, based on how closely they match the common factors that are shared by all positive gene pairs in the target list. For the sake of validating Graph GhostBuster, we repeated the training against 21 interaction types (Supplementary Table 2), sourced from our own Biology Mega Graph. The latter is a harmonized knowledge graph encompassing 322 million known gene-gene relations with full biological granularity, and it is part of our VLab ML library.69 It was created by harmonizing together 11 biological repositories, namely: ComplexPortal,70 human DEPhOsphorylation Database (DEPOD),71 Gene Ontology,6 MicroT (miRBase and MirGeneDB versions),72 miRBase,73 NCBI Gene,74 PhosphoSitePlus,75 Signor,36 STRING76 and TarBase.77 Harmonization was conducted using a well-defined vocabulary of 69 edge labels, which express the biological effect associated with the edge (e.g. “gene A
phosphorylates gene B”); of these 69 levels, the top 21 ones with the highest number of annotations (≥460) were utilized as our training sets.Training dataset preparationMoving on to the training dataset (X), that is, the information that was used to represent the genes in the ML model, all GhostBuster experiments were independently trained using one of four information channels.The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS, 2020 version), is a collection of over 3 million gene expression experiments.78,79 Cell cultures were assessed in different genetic perturbation and treatment conditions, which include compounds, ligands, loss of function by shRNA, loss of function by CRISPR and overexpression by cDNA. Replicates were aggregated into a signature, expressing the differential vector of the treated compared to the untreated group.80 After pre-processing and filtering, the dataset comprised 12,325 genes (examples) by 282,990 biological signatures (features), encompassing 184 cell lines.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a collection of harmonized multiomic experiments from thousands of cancerous and healthy human tissue biopsies.81 We aggregated all available bulk RNA sequencing datasets (as of September 2024). After pre-processing, resulting dataset comprised 36,027 detected genes (examples) by 24,196 biological samples (features), encompassing 34 human tissues.Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) is a general-purpose protein-protein interaction database, encompassing 7 interaction modes.59,76 We excluded all literature-biased interaction modes, namely experimental, database and textmining. We only included the phylogeny-based modes, namely coexpression, neighborhood, cooccurrence and fusion: the former one measures the expression correlation across a large panel of conditions and tissues; the latter three are derived from applying a gene-recognition algorithm across the phylogenetic tree, detecting patterns between gene pairs, that reportedly correlate with the likelihood of the two genes sharing similar functions.82 After pre-processing and filtering, the dataset comprised 18,845 interactor genes (examples) by 49,402 partner genes × interaction modalities (features).Gene Ontology (GO) is a collection of molecular functions, biological processes and cellular compartments, and their respective member genes. We converted the membership lists into a gene-class adjacency matrix. After pre-processing, the dataset comprised 19,237 genes (examples) by 17,873 GO classes (features).Of these channels, LINCS, TCGA and STRING are literature-agnostic, while GO is literature-based, thus, biased. Tabular GhostBuster also included two additional control groups, namely the PPI channel and the GPT channel: differently from the other four, these data sources were not utilized to train a ML model, rather, they relied on a scoring metric.The PPI channel embodies the classic GBA approach: it quantifies a gene’s physical interactions with the target list member genes. Physical interactions were sourced from the experiments section of STRING.76 Genes were then ranked based on this metric, in line with the GBA assumption that, when a gene’s interactors are marked with a given function, the gene itself has increased chances of sharing such function.OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT): the OpenAI GPT-4o mini83 API was utilized to quantify, by a standardized score from 0 to 10 (see Supplementary Table 3), how strongly each gene is currently known in literature for being involved in the phenotype of interest. The scoring sets a “satisfactory” threshold at 6, that is, values equal or smaller than 5 indicate no robust association with the phenotype has been found, so far; values of 6 or above indicate that at least some studies have called the gene to participate in the phenotype.Tabular GhostBuster literature bias in the input is reflected by the literature bias in the predictionTabular GhostBuster was trained in a 10-fold stratified cross-validation setting, independently for each of the 81 phenotypes (Supplementary Table 1), to allow an equal proportion of positive examples in each CV epoch. For each phenotype, the model produced a genome-wide prioritization list for each of the 4 input channels (plus the PPI scoring algorithm). ML metrics were measured in the test dataset prediction, with respect to the original target list (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2). The unbiased channels achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.68 (LINCS), 0.80 (TCGA) and 0.81 (STRING); conversely, the biased channels yielded 0.88 (GO) and 0.86 (PPI). Overall, the biased channels outperformed the unbiased ones. These scores are roughly comparable to the current gold standard predictors for biological processes (BPs), showing ROC-AUCs of 0.6–0.8 for BPs84,85; in 2023, Struct2GO established a new record at 0.873.86These results confirm our initial concern: performance correlates with the amount of literature bias in the data source. Of the five channels, the best performer was GO, which is arguably the “least biological” of the five, as it “predicts literature based on literature itself”. For example, on Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s MSigDB lists, the GO channel yielded a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.96 respectively, in the test dataset: such extreme accuracy is beyond the biologically plausible at our current (highly incomplete) level of mechanistic understanding of both diseases.87 We can conclude that performance becomes misleadingly more gratifying, the more literature-biased our source is, in a “short-circuit”, self-fulfilling-prophecy.Literature bias cannot be eliminated completely from the output, as it inherently affects the target vector Y. After all, it would be impossible to even represent concepts like autophagy or type 1 diabetes, without relying on what we know about such functions or diseases, however biased and imperfect. However, it can be eliminated from the training dataset X. Therefore, we explored whether utilizing an unbiased training dataset X may “pay off” by reducing literature bias in the predicted output, Y′. To address this question, we assessed seven confounders that reportedly play a role in literature bias,3,37,42 sampling their average values in the top-ranked, non-target genes for each of the data channels. These confounders are, for each gene: (i) the number of annotations reported in GO and MSigDB (“richness”); (ii) the coverage in PubMed articles; (iii) the average log-transformed transcriptomic expression across all RNA-sequenced tissues in TCGA; (iv) the percentage of ghost genes, defined as genes in the lower two thirds of the richness distribution; (v) the percentage of ghost genes, defined as the genes in the lower two thirds of the PubMed coverage distribution; (vi) the number of protein-protein interactions with the target gene members; (vii) the average GPT score. We performed the measurement on the n top-ranked output genes, at varying n thresholds, starting from the complete gene space (no threshold), followed by the top 5,000 in GhostBusters’s output, moving progressively up to the top 10 in GhostBusters’s output (Figure 2).As expected, biased sources yielded a higher burden in terms of richness bias, publication-number bias and gene expression bias in their prediction output, and they generally prioritized a smaller fraction of ghost genes than their unbiased counterparts. A more nuanced landscape was observed in the final two confounders, namely PPI and GPT. Their interpretation is non-trivial: for example, a model may return a high GPT score either because the ML is performing well or because it is picking up literature bias—the proportion between these two opposed explanations may depend on the completeness of our current target list, which varies on a case-by-case basis. Cohen’s κ correlation analysis confirmed that the two biased channels’ results show one of the strongest correlations, although weak in absolute terms (κ=0.2-0.3, Supplementary Figure 3). Overall, these results confirm that using a literature-biased input dataset X comes with a more biased prediction Y', suggesting this may be the reason for the boost in ML performance that we observed in literature-biased channels.Tabular GhostBuster’s unbiased sources outperform biased sources in predicting novel biological discoveryThe ultimate biological use for GhostBuster is to generate novel biological knowledge, i.e., identify “unsuspected” genes involved in a given cell function or disease. To this end, the top ranked gene list (in the test dataset’s prediction) should comprise an intermingling of (i) the target genes utilized for training; (ii) some genes that are not part of the “canonical” GO or MSigDB target class, but are still known in literature for playing a role in the phenotype of interest (i.e., have a high GPT score); and (iii) some genes that have never been associated with the provided phenotype before, i.e., have a low GPT score). To check whether this is the case, we measured the percentage of GPT-positive genes (i.e., GPT score of 6 or higher) for each phenotype and data channels (Supplementary Figure 4). Across all five channels, the top-ranked genes exhibited a nice mixture of known genes and unsuspected genes, in the ballpark of a 1-to-1 proportion. Unbiased sources generally produced a higher percentage of unsuspected genes, particularly LINCS (at 82%) and TCGA (at 84%); remarkably, the PPI channel yielded only 50% of unsuspected genes—a testament of the fact that GBA is strongly literature-biased, and biologically uninteresting.51 As we can see, unbiased channels’ prediction combines a strong presence of novel genes with a smaller influence from literature bias (as previously observed): this suggests it is likely to contain novel biological knowledge.One way to assess if this is indeed the case is to retroactively test whether GhostBuster’s top ranked genes are among those whose involvement in the phenotype was recently discovered (and for this reason, did not appear in the target list). To pursue this question, we tasked the OpenAI GPT-4o API to generate a list of novel genes that were discovered between 2022 and 2025, for each of the selected cell functions or diseases. We then excluded the genes that were present in the target list for each of the queried phenotypes. A total of 130 recently discovered genes resulted from this query (Supplementary Table 4). We sampled and manually checked these “recently discovered genes” against the original literature papers, and they appeared for the most part in line with our prompt’s request, with relatively minor errors. For example, in the case of Parkinson’s disease (PD): it is indeed true that TMEM175 received much attention in recent times, after a 2022 paper published in Cell88; conversely, GBA1 has been known to play a role in PD for more than 3 decades,89 thus exemplifying an imperfect hit.Next, for each phenotype, we measured how many of the 130 recently discovered genes were present among those top-ranked by GhostBuster, for each of the data channels, at varying cutoffs. To compare the performance of the biased and the unbiased channels, a logical OR was applied to measure how many recently discovered genes could be detected by any of the unbiased channels (LINCS OR TCGA OR STRING), versus any of the biased channels (GO OR PPI), at each of the cutoffs. This was a challenging attempt, not only due to the incomplete inaccuracy of the GPT query results, but especially considering the fact that “recently discovered genes” are inherently a literature-biased category. The core problem of literature bias is indeed the fact that literature preferentially expands towards genes that are rather well known in the first place, or similar to the already well-known ones. Nevertheless, the unbiased sources markedly outperformed the biased ones, by a factor of 2–3× (Figure 3). For example, with a cutoff at the 99th percentile, hits from the unbiased predictors detected 25 of the 140, while those from the biased predictors only detected 10.Tabular GhostBuster can be applied to make predictions on novel genes involved in cell functions or diseasesSo far, we have established that Tabular GhostBuster is effective at predicting genes that may play a role in a given cell function or disease of interest, even if they are completely unannotated in literature. Specifically, the TCGA channel, and to a lesser extent the STRING and LINCS channels, seem to meet these objectives. We will now exemplify how Tabular GhostBuster can be applied to make novel predictions on a specific phenotype.One way to maximize robustness is to select hits that were ranked high not only by one channel, but by two channels simultaneously, for example TCGA and STRING. Supplementary Figure 5 shows one such example for a cell function (autophagy), while Figure 4 shows one for a disease (Parkinson’s disease, PD). Let’s consider PD as an example, and check if the predictions are biologically plausible. Of note, we must bear in mind that the target list was the MSigDB list for PD, which in turn was sourced from a KEGG pathway that heavily focuses on mitochondrial mechanisms; as a result, we naturally expect a higher prevalence of mitochondrial genes in our prediction as well. Top-ranked, non-target genes highlighted by Tabular GhostBuster include the following:
MPC2 encodes the transporter that leads pyruvate into mitochondria, where it undergoes pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. In 2024 it was identified as a potential drug target for PD and Alzheimer’s disease.90TOMM7 encodes a subunit of a translocase, localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. It was found in 2022 that its biallelic loss of function can lead to a progeroid syndrome.91 Despite having been long known to play a role in Parkin-induced mitophagy, and to influence the mitochondrial import of PINK1 (both Parkin and PINK1 being known prominent PD genes),92 its role in PD pathophysiology is virtually unexplored.NDUFA12 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I. In 2024, it was identified as associated with cognitive decline in elderly women,93 while its involvement in PD has never been explored.PRDX3 and PRDX4 encode a mitochondrion-based and an endoplasmic reticulum-based peroxiredoxin, respectively. The former is known for being a phosphorylation target of LRRK2 (another major PD protagonist); its expression block increases vulnerability to oxidative stress in dopaminergic cells. In March 2025, it was found that by targeting it using gene therapy, it was possible to rescue degeneration in a PD Paraquat mouse model.94CHCHD10 encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in cellular stress response and morphology of mitochondrial cristae; its mutations are known to cause frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Only in 2019, it was found to be a central player in the pathophysiology of a familial form of PD.95This pattern continues for dozens of other genes: as it is apparent, virtually all top-listers in Tabular GhostBuster’s prediction are either genes whose PD involvement was demonstrated very recently, or novel genes that showcase intriguing preliminary grounds in support of their involvement.Tabular GhostBuster can be applied to narrow down a gene’s pathway membershipAnother interesting application of Tabular GhostBuster consists in training the ML model to recognize not only the general cell function, but also its many sub-pathways. This way, GhostBuster will not only provide the user with a prioritization list across the genome, but also, for every gene hit, it will estimate the likelihood by which that gene takes part in each sub-mechanism. To exemplify this point, GhostBuster was trained on three different groups of gene lists, sourced from GO41:
DNA damage response, and 7 sub-mechanisms: double-strand break repair, positive regulation of double-strand break repair, positive regulation of homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), nucleotide-excision repair (NER), base-excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR) (Figure 5).Autophagy, and 6 sub-mechanisms: DNA damage response, autophagy of mitochondrion, macroautophagy, microautophagy, positive regulation of autophagy and negative regulation of autophagy (Supplementary Figure 6).Generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and 8 sub-mechanisms: energy homeostasis, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, oxidative phosphorylation, energy reserve metabolic process, glycolytic process, mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial translation (Supplementary Figure 7).Because most of the predicted genes are largely uncharacterized, it is impossible to provide systematic evidence supporting the reliability of the predicted sub-mechanisms. As a result, the proof for such predictions will necessarily go through experimental validation.Tabular GhostBuster can be applied for the prioritization of intergenic GWAS gene hitsOne of the most important open questions in gene disease prediction is the prioritization of statistically significant hits from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These large-scale studies perform genomic characterization on thousands, or even tens of thousands of participants for a given disease of interest: such large sample size enables the detection not only of the high-penetrance genes that may cause the familial forms of the disease, but also of the low-penetrance risk variants that slightly increase the risk (or conversely, protective variants that decrease the risk), in a classic genotype-environment interaction paradigm. Although very powerful, GWAS studies are cursed by a high number of false positives, opening the doors for bioinformaticians to develop efficient prioritization tools. Furthermore, many of the statistically significant hits localize in non-coding regions, giving rise to an interpretability issue.96–98 When a hit falls in a region far away from any protein-coding genes, still, in most cases it exerts its action by controlling a coding-gene: in roughly ~50% of the cases, this trans-regulated gene happens to be the closest protein-coding gene in the chromosome’s primary sequence to the hit locus.99 However, in the remainder 50% cases, the controlled gene can be located elsewhere, even on a different chromosome, and may end up localizing in proximity of the hit locus due to the 3D DNA folding. Traditionally, the closest genes in the primary sequence have been used as a proxy, although acknowledging that this may often lead to false positives.96–98To showcase another potential use case of Tabular GhostBuster, we applied it on a GWAS prioritization task for 6 clinically relevant phenotypes, namely PD, AD, schizophrenia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolism. For each of these, we trained two independent models, differing by the nature of their respective target lists:
The MSigDB-based model was trained to recognize a list of genes that are known for being mechanistically involved in the phenotype, sourced from MSigDB.18 As a result, this model scores how closely each gene “looks like” the known genes implicated in phenotype of interest’s pathway.The PheGenI-based model was trained to recognize a list of genes highlighted by GWAS studies for that phenotype, sourced from PheGenI.21 Such list includes genes housing (or neighboring) a statistically significant mutation, for which the identity of the target gene is known; it also includes genes that are the closest, at primary sequence level, to an intergenic hit, whose involvement is thereby uncertain. The inclusion of the latter in the target list is debatable, as only a portion of them will be true positives. We made the choice to include them, mainly to boost example numerosity. After all, GhostBuster’s job is to generalize the best rule that encompasses the target list as a whole: then, it follows that the inclusion of a minority of scattered false positives does not undermine the model’s prediction substantially, as the model only picks up factors that are the most shared across the entirety of the list. Overall, this model scores how closely each gene “looks like” the GWAS gene hits for the phenotype of interest.After training both models, a prioritization plot was performed, while limiting the plot to only the genes that are intergenic hits for that phenotype, according to PheGenI. The general idea is that, the intergenic list contains a majority of false positives; of these, the genes that are most susceptible to be true positives are those that either match the shared factors among the mechanistically involved genes, or match the shared factors of the whole GWAS hit list (including the intragenic and near-genic); or even better, the “dual hits” that satisfy both of such criteria at once.Representative results for PD, type 2 diabetes mellitus and schizophrenia are reported in Figure 6, Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 7, respectively. While it would be impossible to prove the validity of these results without performing a mechanistic study, a literature search for many of the single or dual hits suggests that their disease implication is strongly justified on theoretical grounds. For example:
HLA-DRB1 (dual hit for PD) is a critical component of the human leukocyte antigen system, making it a central player in inflammation-related diseases like neurodegeneration; unsurprisingly, limited evidence already exists that demonstrates a specific association between HLA-DRB1 and PD100; interestingly, the interaction between alpha-synuclein and the HLA-DRB1 protein at intestinal level has been shown to be a determinant factor in an early-stage model of PD.101DDRGK1 (single hit for PD) encodes an essential regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and the NF-κB inflammation pathway, both of which make its role in PD highly plausible.102FITM2 (dual hit for type 2 diabetes mellitus) encodes an essential factor in lipid droplet formation, a process that is required to store saturated fatty acids into lipid droplets within adipocytes. Notably, the excess of saturated fatty acids is a known toxicity mediator on beta-cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus: although still very limited, experimental evidence has been disclosed that specifically highlights FITM2 as a possible therapeutic target.103CAMK1D (single hit for type 2 diabetes mellitus) encodes a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that participates in a wide variety of cellular processes; again, a small number of papers have confirmed its involvement in insulin release and insulin sensitivity, as well as its role as a genetic risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.104PDZD8 (dual hit for schizophrenia) encodes a lipid transfer protein involved in lipophagy; interestingly, a recent work showed that its knock-out in mice primarily affects the brain, leading to changes in emotional, cognitive and mnestic tasks, displaying some degree of overlap to schizophrenia.105Nectin1 (single hit for schizophrenia) encodes a cell adhesion molecule involved in the formation and maintenance of synaptic joints, as well as neuroplasticity. Although the specific role of nectin 1 in schizophrenia has not been well characterized yet, cell adhesion molecules in general (and the nectin family in particular) are thought to be some of the core mechanistic players in neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia.106The list could extend considerably. To recapitulate, the reported hit genes were selected among the intergenic gene hits, on the basis that they showed similarity to either the known disease pathways, or the rest of the GWAS hit list as a whole, or both. Such striking coincidence is allusive that each of these genes is among the true positive hits. In fact, the reported literature analysis on all the representative example genes confirmed that their involvement is biologically plausible. This panel exemplifies how Tabular GhostBuster can be deployed for a systematic prioritization of GWAS intergenic hits.Graph GhostBuster trained on literature-unbiased sources determines less literature bias in the predictionsGraph GhostBuster was trained on an edge prediction task, whereby nodes represented genes, and edges represented directed gene-gene relations. Positive examples of gene-gene edges were sourced from 21 individual levels from the Biology Mega Graph knowledge graph (Supplementary Table 2), corresponding to different biological or biochemical gene-gene relation types (e.g., methylates, relocates, downregulates_quantity_by_repression, etc.). The 21 levels were selected in terms of number of edge annotations; filtering the levels with at least 460 annotations, and discarding the others. Conversely, negative edges were sourced in two ways, corresponding to two independent edge prediction tasks:
R task (random negatives): edges were randomly generated, in a 50:1 proportion to the number of positive examples. The rationale was based on the sparsity of the positive gene-gene edges (density: min 0.00029%, max 1.54%, mean 0.12%). As a result, by taking random edges, we can assume to be introducing a very limited proportion of false negatives in the negative edge dataset.C task (curated negatives): given a positive layer of the Biology Mega Graph (say, “upregulates activity”), edges were sourced from its corresponding antonymic layer (“downregulates activity”), when available; this was only possible for 10 out of 21 levels, namely, the upregulation- and downregulation-based layers. The rationale was that, when a gene upregulates another gene, usually it does not also downregulate the same gene; this is of course an imperfect assumption, as some regulatory relations are known for being cell type-dependent, even in their sign.36Node features were sourced from the same data channels used to train Tabular GhostBuster, namely the three literature-unbiased sources LINCS, TCGA, STRING; and the literature-biased source GO.A graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model was employed, in a classic edge prediction task. Training was conducted independently for each of the 21 gene-gene relation types, for each task (R or C), and for each of the 4 data sources, resulting in (21 + 10) × 4 = 124 models being trained. In each model, the positive and the negative edges were randomly split into a training, validation and test dataset, in 8 : 1 : 1 proportions, respectively.At the end of the training, performance was measured by ROC-AUC in the test dataset (Figure 7). Surprisingly, the TCGA channel achieved a comparable performance to that of the biased GO channel, with most ROC-AUCs falling in the 0.90–0.95 range. Conversely, the LINCS and STRING markedly fell back, performance-wise. Across the 29 relation type/task combinations, TCGA was reported as the best performer in about 50% cases—even more successful than the corresponding result from Tabular GhostBuster, where the use of literature-unbiased sources came with a small penalty in the ML metrics. Additionally, it further confirmed TCGA’s role as an ideal, unbiased information source for GAP tasks.Next, we checked whether the use of a literature-unbiased data source paid off in terms of literature bias in the results, analogously to what had been done for Tabular GhostBuster. The confounders were again metrics that reportedly correlate with literature bias,3,37,42 namely, for every edge: (i) the number of GO and MSigDB annotations of the two genes delimiting the edge (“richness”); (ii) their coverage in PubMed articles; (iii) their average log-transformed transcriptomic expression across all RNA-sequenced tissues in TCGA; (iv) the percentage of ghost genes, defined as genes in the lower two thirds of the richness distribution; (v) the percentage of ghost genes, defined as genes in the lower two thirds of the PubMed coverage distribution. They were measured by cutting the GNN predicted edges at different thresholds based on the logits in the predicted adjacency matrix, starting from the complete adjacency matrix (no threshold); next moving on to the genes in the top 50,000 highest-ranked predicted edges; then the top 30,000, etc., up to the top 100 (Figure 8).Like in the case of Tabular GhostBuster, once again, the biased source (GO) reported a higher literature-bias burden over the best-performing literature-unbiased source (TCGA) across every explored confounder, thus confirming the hypothesis.Graph GhostBuster can be utilized to predict gene interactors with modality-specific resolutionSo far, we have established that Graph GhostBuster is effective at predicting gene-gene interactions at full mechanistic granularity, namely distinguishing biological interaction types such as up/downregulation, activation/deactivation, phosphorylation, acetylation, etc. However, the ultimate step is to check whether novel biological insight can be extracted from such predictions.Of note, because the current implementation relies on a classic dot product-based GCN, the output is agnostic of directionality (e.g., A
phosphorylates
B, versus B
phosphorylates
A); however, directionality is usually inferable from the biological background of the two genes (e.g., if B is a kinase, then it is B that phosphorylates
A, and not vice-versa).As an example, let’s consider again alpha-synuclein (αS protein, SNCA gene). Among the top 28 hits for up- or downregulation-related terms (Supplementary Table 5), 18 interactors had already been annotated in the Biology Mega Graph; conversely, 13 of them were novel, including the following:
NOTCH2 (hit for downregulates_quantity in SNCA) encodes one of the notch receptors, which are a cornerstone of the ontogenesis of multiple tissues, including the brain. Interestingly, NOTCH2 has been often found significantly dysregulated in alpha-synucleinopathy patients. For example, a recent transcriptomic panel pinpointed the notch pathway, and specifically NOTCH2, as the most upregulated pathway in PD patients’ blood.107 Likewise, a “major intrinsically disordered NOTCH2-associated receptor 2” (KIAA1024L) was recently identified as a possible central mediator of αS vulnerability, as its knock-out recapitulates many of the PD hallmarks, including specific dopaminergic loss in the substantia nigra.108PTK2 (hit for upregulates_activity in SNCA) encodes protein tyrosine kinase 2, generally known for being a high-level regulator in cell cycle and survival. Interestingly, research from the early 2020’s highlighted a key role in tau- and TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration, with specific focus on vulnerability to the ubiquitin-proteasome system impairment. Kinase inhibitor screening highlighted it as the best neurotoxicity suppressor on a proteasome impairment model109; the mechanism was later identified to involve PTK2’s ability to phosphorylate p62, regulating the p62 pathway which promotes autophagy and misfolded proteins’ turnover.110 While PTK2’s potential role in αS vulnerability has not been investigated yet, it remains extremely plausible based on such background.MLC1 (hit for upregulates_quantity in SNCA) encodes an astrocytic membrane transporter, which has been implicated in astrocyte activation—a key component in the pro-inflammatory mechanisms that are shared across virtually all neurological conditions, including neurodegeneration, stroke, trauma and epilepsy. A specific relation with αS has never been investigated.111As an alternative example, let’s consider TDP-43 (TARDBP gene), which is the central protein in TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the TDP-43 subtype of frontotemporal dementia. Again, among the top 28 hits for up- or downregulation-related terms (Supplementary Table 6), 16 interactors already appeared in the Biology Mega Graph, whereas 12 were novel, for example:
CDKN1A (hit for downregulates_quantity in TARDB) encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which is a direct transcriptional target of p53 and has been implicated in neuronal death. Most notably, a 2018 paper explicitly reported that “expression of Cdkn1 reduces endogenous TDP-43 levels suggesting a reciprocal interaction with TDP-43”112; this matches exactly Graph GhostBuster’s prediction, despite this relation did not appear in the Biology Mega Graph that was used to train it.SMAD3 and SMAD4 (hits for downregulates_activity in TARDB) encode some of the signal transducers of the TGB-β pathways, involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Interestingly, a paper reported the accumulation of various SMAD proteins within TDP-43 intracellular inclusions found in the spinal cord of ALS patients, suggesting that TDP-43 accumulation brings about an impairment of the TGF-β pathway.Strikingly, almost all of the novel biological predictions from Graph GhostBuster are biologically interesting, and plausible based on the limited existing literature. These representative examples confirm that Graph GhostBuster is capable of predicting novel biological knowledge, that was not part of its training dataset.In conclusion, the elegance and usefulness of both Tabular and Graph GhostBuster ultimately lie in their unbiased quality: the ability to pinpoint, within an ocean of reported “limited evidence”, which hypotheses are the worthiest of being explored further, making the tool widely adoptable by the biological community.

Target dataset preparationIn Tabular GhostBuster, the target (Y) is a list of genes that are currently known to be involved in a specific “phenotype” of interest (a cell function, cell compartment or disease, say, “autophagy”); the prediction output is a prioritized gene list, based on how closely they match the common factors shared by all positive genes in the target list—i.e., a genome-wide ranking of genes, based on how likely they are to be involved in, say, autophagy. For the sake of validating Tabular GhostBuster, we repeated the training against 81 phenotypes (Supplementary Table 1), selected with the intent to cover biological fields of great scientific relevance. These 81 phenotypes include: 50 cell functions and 4 cell localization from Gene Ontology (GO) dataset41; 21 lists of genes involved in disease, taken from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)18; and 6 lists of gene hits from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), sourced from the Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI).21 Among the 81 target classes, we included three clusters that represent sub-mechanisms of the same biological processes, namely 8 classes of DNA damage response, 6 classes of autophagy and 9 classes of metabolism-related functions. A gene-centric t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) plot of the 81 gene classes confirmed that they sample the entire “space” of cell biology in a fairly uniform way (Supplementary Figure 1).Conversely, in Graph GhostBuster, the target list is represented by a set of gene-gene pairs that interact by a specific biological modality (e.g., phosphorylation); the prediction output is a prioritized gene pair list, based on how closely they match the common factors that are shared by all positive gene pairs in the target list. For the sake of validating Graph GhostBuster, we repeated the training against 21 interaction types (Supplementary Table 2), sourced from our own Biology Mega Graph. The latter is a harmonized knowledge graph encompassing 322 million known gene-gene relations with full biological granularity, and it is part of our VLab ML library.69 It was created by harmonizing together 11 biological repositories, namely: ComplexPortal,70 human DEPhOsphorylation Database (DEPOD),71 Gene Ontology,6 MicroT (miRBase and MirGeneDB versions),72 miRBase,73 NCBI Gene,74 PhosphoSitePlus,75 Signor,36 STRING76 and TarBase.77 Harmonization was conducted using a well-defined vocabulary of 69 edge labels, which express the biological effect associated with the edge (e.g. “gene A
phosphorylates gene B”); of these 69 levels, the top 21 ones with the highest number of annotations (≥460) were utilized as our training sets.

Training dataset preparationMoving on to the training dataset (X), that is, the information that was used to represent the genes in the ML model, all GhostBuster experiments were independently trained using one of four information channels.The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS, 2020 version), is a collection of over 3 million gene expression experiments.78,79 Cell cultures were assessed in different genetic perturbation and treatment conditions, which include compounds, ligands, loss of function by shRNA, loss of function by CRISPR and overexpression by cDNA. Replicates were aggregated into a signature, expressing the differential vector of the treated compared to the untreated group.80 After pre-processing and filtering, the dataset comprised 12,325 genes (examples) by 282,990 biological signatures (features), encompassing 184 cell lines.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a collection of harmonized multiomic experiments from thousands of cancerous and healthy human tissue biopsies.81 We aggregated all available bulk RNA sequencing datasets (as of September 2024). After pre-processing, resulting dataset comprised 36,027 detected genes (examples) by 24,196 biological samples (features), encompassing 34 human tissues.Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) is a general-purpose protein-protein interaction database, encompassing 7 interaction modes.59,76 We excluded all literature-biased interaction modes, namely experimental, database and textmining. We only included the phylogeny-based modes, namely coexpression, neighborhood, cooccurrence and fusion: the former one measures the expression correlation across a large panel of conditions and tissues; the latter three are derived from applying a gene-recognition algorithm across the phylogenetic tree, detecting patterns between gene pairs, that reportedly correlate with the likelihood of the two genes sharing similar functions.82 After pre-processing and filtering, the dataset comprised 18,845 interactor genes (examples) by 49,402 partner genes × interaction modalities (features).Gene Ontology (GO) is a collection of molecular functions, biological processes and cellular compartments, and their respective member genes. We converted the membership lists into a gene-class adjacency matrix. After pre-processing, the dataset comprised 19,237 genes (examples) by 17,873 GO classes (features).Of these channels, LINCS, TCGA and STRING are literature-agnostic, while GO is literature-based, thus, biased. Tabular GhostBuster also included two additional control groups, namely the PPI channel and the GPT channel: differently from the other four, these data sources were not utilized to train a ML model, rather, they relied on a scoring metric.The PPI channel embodies the classic GBA approach: it quantifies a gene’s physical interactions with the target list member genes. Physical interactions were sourced from the experiments section of STRING.76 Genes were then ranked based on this metric, in line with the GBA assumption that, when a gene’s interactors are marked with a given function, the gene itself has increased chances of sharing such function.OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT): the OpenAI GPT-4o mini83 API was utilized to quantify, by a standardized score from 0 to 10 (see Supplementary Table 3), how strongly each gene is currently known in literature for being involved in the phenotype of interest. The scoring sets a “satisfactory” threshold at 6, that is, values equal or smaller than 5 indicate no robust association with the phenotype has been found, so far; values of 6 or above indicate that at least some studies have called the gene to participate in the phenotype.

Training dataset preparation

Moving on to the training dataset (X), that is, the information that was used to represent the genes in the ML model, all GhostBuster experiments were independently trained using one of four information channels.

The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS, 2020 version), is a collection of over 3 million gene expression experiments.78,79 Cell cultures were assessed in different genetic perturbation and treatment conditions, which include compounds, ligands, loss of function by shRNA, loss of function by CRISPR and overexpression by cDNA.

Tabular GhostBuster literature bias in the input is reflected by the literature bias in the predictionTabular GhostBuster was trained in a 10-fold stratified cross-validation setting, independently for each of the 81 phenotypes (Supplementary Table 1), to allow an equal proportion of positive examples in each CV epoch. For each phenotype, the model produced a genome-wide prioritization list for each of the 4 input channels (plus the PPI scoring algorithm). ML metrics were measured in the test dataset prediction, with respect to the original target list (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2). The unbiased channels achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.68 (LINCS), 0.80 (TCGA) and 0.81 (STRING); conversely, the biased channels yielded 0.88 (GO) and 0.86 (PPI). Overall, the biased channels outperformed the unbiased ones. These scores are roughly comparable to the current gold standard predictors for biological processes (BPs), showing ROC-AUCs of 0.6–0.8 for BPs84,85; in 2023, Struct2GO established a new record at 0.873.86These results confirm our initial concern: performance correlates with the amount of literature bias in the data source. Of the five channels, the best performer was GO, which is arguably the “least biological” of the five, as it “predicts literature based on literature itself”. For example, on Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s MSigDB lists, the GO channel yielded a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.96 respectively, in the test dataset: such extreme accuracy is beyond the biologically plausible at our current (highly incomplete) level of mechanistic understanding of both diseases.87 We can conclude that performance becomes misleadingly more gratifying, the more literature-biased our source is, in a “short-circuit”, self-fulfilling-prophecy.Literature bias cannot be eliminated completely from the output, as it inherently affects the target vector Y. After all, it would be impossible to even represent concepts like autophagy or type 1 diabetes, without relying on what we know about such functions or diseases, however biased and imperfect. However, it can be eliminated from the training dataset X. Therefore, we explored whether utilizing an unbiased training dataset X may “pay off” by reducing literature bias in the predicted output, Y′. To address this question, we assessed seven confounders that reportedly play a role in literature bias,3,37,42 sampling their average values in the top-ranked, non-target genes for each of the data channels. These confounders are, for each gene: (i) the number of annotations reported in GO and MSigDB (“richness”); (ii) the coverage in PubMed articles; (iii) the average log-transformed transcriptomic expression across all RNA-sequenced tissues in TCGA; (iv) the percentage of ghost genes, defined as genes in the lower two thirds of the richness distribution; (v) the percentage of ghost genes, defined as the genes in the lower two thirds of the PubMed coverage distribution; (vi) the number of protein-protein interactions with the target gene members; (vii) the average GPT score. We performed the measurement on the n top-ranked output genes, at varying n thresholds, starting from the complete gene space (no threshold), followed by the top 5,000 in GhostBusters’s output, moving progressively up to the top 10 in GhostBusters’s output (Figure 2).As expected, biased sources yielded a higher burden in terms of richness bias, publication-number bias and gene expression bias in their prediction output, and they generally prioritized a smaller fraction of ghost genes than their unbiased counterparts. A more nuanced landscape was observed in the final two confounders, namely PPI and GPT. Their interpretation is non-trivial: for example, a model may return a high GPT score either because the ML is performing well or because it is picking up literature bias—the proportion between these two opposed explanations may depend on the completeness of our current target list, which varies on a case-by-case basis. Cohen’s κ correlation analysis confirmed that the two biased channels’ results show one of the strongest correlations, although weak in absolute terms (κ=0.2-0.3, Supplementary Figure 3). Overall, these results confirm that using a literature-biased input dataset X comes with a more biased prediction Y', suggesting this may be the reason for the boost in ML performance that we observed in literature-biased channels.

Tabular GhostBuster’s unbiased sources outperform biased sources in predicting novel biological discoveryThe ultimate biological use for GhostBuster is to generate novel biological knowledge, i.e., identify “unsuspected” genes involved in a given cell function or disease. To this end, the top ranked gene list (in the test dataset’s prediction) should comprise an intermingling of (i) the target genes utilized for training; (ii) some genes that are not part of the “canonical” GO or MSigDB target class, but are still known in literature for playing a role in the phenotype of interest (i.e., have a high GPT score); and (iii) some genes that have never been associated with the provided phenotype before, i.e., have a low GPT score). To check whether this is the case, we measured the percentage of GPT-positive genes (i.e., GPT score of 6 or higher) for each phenotype and data channels (Supplementary Figure 4). Across all five channels, the top-ranked genes exhibited a nice mixture of known genes and unsuspected genes, in the ballpark of a 1-to-1 proportion. Unbiased sources generally produced a higher percentage of unsuspected genes, particularly LINCS (at 82%) and TCGA (at 84%); remarkably, the PPI channel yielded only 50% of unsuspected genes—a testament of the fact that GBA is strongly literature-biased, and biologically uninteresting.51 As we can see, unbiased channels’ prediction combines a strong presence of novel genes with a smaller influence from literature bias (as previously observed): this suggests it is likely to contain novel biological knowledge.One way to assess if this is indeed the case is to retroactively test whether GhostBuster’s top ranked genes are among those whose involvement in the phenotype was recently discovered (and for this reason, did not appear in the target list). To pursue this question, we tasked the OpenAI GPT-4o API to generate a list of novel genes that were discovered between 2022 and 2025, for each of the selected cell functions or diseases. We then excluded the genes that were present in the target list for each of the queried phenotypes. A total of 130 recently discovered genes resulted from this query (Supplementary Table 4). We sampled and manually checked these “recently discovered genes” against the original literature papers, and they appeared for the most part in line with our prompt’s request, with relatively minor errors. For example, in the case of Parkinson’s disease (PD): it is indeed true that TMEM175 received much attention in recent times, after a 2022 paper published in Cell88; conversely, GBA1 has been known to play a role in PD for more than 3 decades,89 thus exemplifying an imperfect hit.Next, for each phenotype, we measured how many of the 130 recently discovered genes were present among those top-ranked by GhostBuster, for each of the data channels, at varying cutoffs. To compare the performance of the biased and the unbiased channels, a logical OR was applied to measure how many recently discovered genes could be detected by any of the unbiased channels (LINCS OR TCGA OR STRING), versus any of the biased channels (GO OR PPI), at each of the cutoffs. This was a challenging attempt, not only due to the incomplete inaccuracy of the GPT query results, but especially considering the fact that “recently discovered genes” are inherently a literature-biased category. The core problem of literature bias is indeed the fact that literature preferentially expands towards genes that are rather well known in the first place, or similar to the already well-known ones. Nevertheless, the unbiased sources markedly outperformed the biased ones, by a factor of 2–3× (Figure 3). For example, with a cutoff at the 99th percentile, hits from the unbiased predictors detected 25 of the 140, while those from the biased predictors only detected 10.

Tabular GhostBuster can be applied to make predictions on novel genes involved in cell functions or diseasesSo far, we have established that Tabular GhostBuster is effective at predicting genes that may play a role in a given cell function or disease of interest, even if they are completely unannotated in literature. Specifically, the TCGA channel, and to a lesser extent the STRING and LINCS channels, seem to meet these objectives. We will now exemplify how Tabular GhostBuster can be applied to make novel predictions on a specific phenotype.One way to maximize robustness is to select hits that were ranked high not only by one channel, but by two channels simultaneously, for example TCGA and STRING. Supplementary Figure 5 shows one such example for a cell function (autophagy), while Figure 4 shows one for a disease (Parkinson’s disease, PD). Let’s consider PD as an example, and check if the predictions are biologically plausible. Of note, we must bear in mind that the target list was the MSigDB list for PD, which in turn was sourced from a KEGG pathway that heavily focuses on mitochondrial mechanisms; as a result, we naturally expect a higher prevalence of mitochondrial genes in our prediction as well. Top-ranked, non-target genes highlighted by Tabular GhostBuster include the following:
MPC2 encodes the transporter that leads pyruvate into mitochondria, where it undergoes pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. In 2024 it was identified as a potential drug target for PD and Alzheimer’s disease.90TOMM7 encodes a subunit of a translocase, localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. It was found in 2022 that its biallelic loss of function can lead to a progeroid syndrome.91 Despite having been long known to play a role in Parkin-induced mitophagy, and to influence the mitochondrial import of PINK1 (both Parkin and PINK1 being known prominent PD genes),92 its role in PD pathophysiology is virtually unexplored.NDUFA12 encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I. In 2024, it was identified as associated with cognitive decline in elderly women,93 while its involvement in PD has never been explored.PRDX3 and PRDX4 encode a mitochondrion-based and an endoplasmic reticulum-based peroxiredoxin, respectively. The former is known for being a phosphorylation target of LRRK2 (another major PD protagonist); its expression block increases vulnerability to oxidative stress in dopaminergic cells. In March 2025, it was found that by targeting it using gene therapy, it was possible to rescue degeneration in a PD Paraquat mouse model.94CHCHD10 encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in cellular stress response and morphology of mitochondrial cristae; its mutations are known to cause frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Only in 2019, it was found to be a central player in the pathophysiology of a familial form of PD.95This pattern continues for dozens of other genes: as it is apparent, virtually all top-listers in Tabular GhostBuster’s prediction are either genes whose PD involvement was demonstrated very recently, or novel genes that showcase intriguing preliminary grounds in support of their involvement.

This pattern continues for dozens of other genes: as it is apparent, virtually all top-listers in Tabular GhostBuster’s prediction are either genes whose PD involvement was demonstrated very recently, or novel genes that showcase intriguing preliminary grounds in support of their involvement.

Tabular GhostBuster can be applied to narrow down a gene’s pathway membershipAnother interesting application of Tabular GhostBuster consists in training the ML model to recognize not only the general cell function, but also its many sub-pathways. This way, GhostBuster will not only provide the user with a prioritization list across the genome, but also, for every gene hit, it will estimate the likelihood by which that gene takes part in each sub-mechanism. To exemplify this point, GhostBuster was trained on three different groups of gene lists, sourced from GO41:
DNA damage response, and 7 sub-mechanisms: double-strand break repair, positive regulation of double-strand break repair, positive regulation of homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), nucleotide-excision repair (NER), base-excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR) (Figure 5).Autophagy, and 6 sub-mechanisms: DNA damage response, autophagy of mitochondrion, macroautophagy, microautophagy, positive regulation of autophagy and negative regulation of autophagy (Supplementary Figure 6).Generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and 8 sub-mechanisms: energy homeostasis, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex, oxidative phosphorylation, energy reserve metabolic process, glycolytic process, mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial translation (Supplementary Figure 7).Because most of the predicted genes are largely uncharacterized, it is impossible to provide systematic evidence supporting the reliability of the predicted sub-mechanisms. As a result, the proof for such predictions will necessarily go through experimental validation.

Tabular GhostBuster can be applied for the prioritization of intergenic GWAS gene hitsOne of the most important open questions in gene disease prediction is the prioritization of statistically significant hits from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These large-scale studies perform genomic characterization on thousands, or even tens of thousands of participants for a given disease of interest: such large sample size enables the detection not only of the high-penetrance genes that may cause the familial forms of the disease, but also of the low-penetrance risk variants that slightly increase the risk (or conversely, protective variants that decrease the risk), in a classic genotype-environment interaction paradigm. Although very powerful, GWAS studies are cursed by a high number of false positives, opening the doors for bioinformaticians to develop efficient prioritization tools. Furthermore, many of the statistically significant hits localize in non-coding regions, giving rise to an interpretability issue.96–98 When a hit falls in a region far away from any protein-coding genes, still, in most cases it exerts its action by controlling a coding-gene: in roughly ~50% of the cases, this trans-regulated gene happens to be the closest protein-coding gene in the chromosome’s primary sequence to the hit locus.99 However, in the remainder 50% cases, the controlled gene can be located elsewhere, even on a different chromosome, and may end up localizing in proximity of the hit locus due to the 3D DNA folding. Traditionally, the closest genes in the primary sequence have been used as a proxy, although acknowledging that this may often lead to false positives.96–98To showcase another potential use case of Tabular GhostBuster, we applied it on a GWAS prioritization task for 6 clinically relevant phenotypes, namely PD, AD, schizophrenia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolism. For each of these, we trained two independent models, differing by the nature of their respective target lists:
The MSigDB-based model was trained to recognize a list of genes that are known for being mechanistically involved in the phenotype, sourced from MSigDB.18 As a result, this model scores how closely each gene “looks like” the known genes implicated in phenotype of interest’s pathway.The PheGenI-based model was trained to recognize a list of genes highlighted by GWAS studies for that phenotype, sourced from PheGenI.21 Such list includes genes housing (or neighboring) a statistically significant mutation, for which the identity of the target gene is known; it also includes genes that are the closest, at primary sequence level, to an intergenic hit, whose involvement is thereby uncertain. The inclusion of the latter in the target list is debatable, as only a portion of them will be true positives. We made the choice to include them, mainly to boost example numerosity. After all, GhostBuster’s job is to generalize the best rule that encompasses the target list as a whole: then, it follows that the inclusion of a minority of scattered false positives does not undermine the model’s prediction substantially, as the model only picks up factors that are the most shared across the entirety of the list. Overall, this model scores how closely each gene “looks like” the GWAS gene hits for the phenotype of interest.After training both models, a prioritization plot was performed, while limiting the plot to only the genes that are intergenic hits for that phenotype, according to PheGenI. The general idea is that, the intergenic list contains a majority of false positives; of these, the genes that are most susceptible to be true positives are those that either match the shared factors among the mechanistically involved genes, or match the shared factors of the whole GWAS hit list (including the intragenic and near-genic); or even better, the “dual hits” that satisfy both of such criteria at once.Representative results for PD, type 2 diabetes mellitus and schizophrenia are reported in Figure 6, Supplementary Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 7, respectively. While it would be impossible to prove the validity of these results without performing a mechanistic study, a literature search for many of the single or dual hits suggests that their disease implication is strongly justified on theoretical grounds. For example:
HLA-DRB1 (dual hit for PD) is a critical component of the human leukocyte antigen system, making it a central player in inflammation-related diseases like neurodegeneration; unsurprisingly, limited evidence already exists that demonstrates a specific association between HLA-DRB1 and PD100; interestingly, the interaction between alpha-synuclein and the HLA-DRB1 protein at intestinal level has been shown to be a determinant factor in an early-stage model of PD.101DDRGK1 (single hit for PD) encodes an essential regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and the NF-κB inflammation pathway, both of which make its role in PD highly plausible.102FITM2 (dual hit for type 2 diabetes mellitus) encodes an essential factor in lipid droplet formation, a process that is required to store saturated fatty acids into lipid droplets within adipocytes. Notably, the excess of saturated fatty acids is a known toxicity mediator on beta-cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus: although still very limited, experimental evidence has been disclosed that specifically highlights FITM2 as a possible therapeutic target.103CAMK1D (single hit for type 2 diabetes mellitus) encodes a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that participates in a wide variety of cellular processes; again, a small number of papers have confirmed its involvement in insulin release and insulin sensitivity, as well as its role as a genetic risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.104PDZD8 (dual hit for schizophrenia) encodes a lipid transfer protein involved in lipophagy; interestingly, a recent work showed that its knock-out in mice primarily affects the brain, leading to changes in emotional, cognitive and mnestic tasks, displaying some degree of overlap to schizophrenia.105Nectin1 (single hit for schizophrenia) encodes a cell adhesion molecule involved in the formation and maintenance of synaptic joints, as well as neuroplasticity. Although the specific role of nectin 1 in schizophrenia has not been well characterized yet, cell adhesion molecules in general (and the nectin family in particular) are thought to be some of the core mechanistic players in neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia.106The list could extend considerably. To recapitulate, the reported hit genes were selected among the intergenic gene hits, on the basis that they showed similarity to either the known disease pathways, or the rest of the GWAS hit list as a whole, or both. Such striking coincidence is allusive that each of these genes is among the true positive hits. In fact, the reported literature analysis on all the representative example genes confirmed that their involvement is biologically plausible. This panel exemplifies how Tabular GhostBuster can be deployed for a systematic prioritization of GWAS intergenic hits.

Graph GhostBuster trained on literature-unbiased sources determines less literature bias in the predictionsGraph GhostBuster was trained on an edge prediction task, whereby nodes represented genes, and edges represented directed gene-gene relations. Positive examples of gene-gene edges were sourced from 21 individual levels from the Biology Mega Graph knowledge graph (Supplementary Table 2), corresponding to different biological or biochemical gene-gene relation types (e.g., methylates, relocates, downregulates_quantity_by_repression, etc.). The 21 levels were selected in terms of number of edge annotations; filtering the levels with at least 460 annotations, and discarding the others. Conversely, negative edges were sourced in two ways, corresponding to two independent edge prediction tasks:
R task (random negatives): edges were randomly generated, in a 50:1 proportion to the number of positive examples. The rationale was based on the sparsity of the positive gene-gene edges (density: min 0.00029%, max 1.54%, mean 0.12%). As a result, by taking random edges, we can assume to be introducing a very limited proportion of false negatives in the negative edge dataset.C task (curated negatives): given a positive layer of the Biology Mega Graph (say, “upregulates activity”), edges were sourced from its corresponding antonymic layer (“downregulates activity”), when available; this was only possible for 10 out of 21 levels, namely, the upregulation- and downregulation-based layers. The rationale was that, when a gene upregulates another gene, usually it does not also downregulate the same gene; this is of course an imperfect assumption, as some regulatory relations are known for being cell type-dependent, even in their sign.36Node features were sourced from the same data channels used to train Tabular GhostBuster, namely the three literature-unbiased sources LINCS, TCGA, STRING; and the literature-biased source GO.A graph convolutional neural network (GCN) model was employed, in a classic edge prediction task. Training was conducted independently for each of the 21 gene-gene relation types, for each task (R or C), and for each of the 4 data sources, resulting in (21 + 10) × 4 = 124 models being trained. In each model, the positive and the negative edges were randomly split into a training, validation and test dataset, in 8 : 1 : 1 proportions, respectively.At the end of the training, performance was measured by ROC-AUC in the test dataset (Figure 7). Surprisingly, the TCGA channel achieved a comparable performance to that of the biased GO channel, with most ROC-AUCs falling in the 0.90–0.95 range. Conversely, the LINCS and STRING markedly fell back, performance-wise. Across the 29 relation type/task combinations, TCGA was reported as the best performer in about 50% cases—even more successful than the corresponding result from Tabular GhostBuster, where the use of literature-unbiased sources came with a small penalty in the ML metrics. Additionally, it further confirmed TCGA’s role as an ideal, unbiased information source for GAP tasks.Next, we checked whether the use of a literature-unbiased data source paid off in terms of literature bias in the results, analogously to what had been done for Tabular GhostBuster. The confounders were again metrics that reportedly correlate with literature bias,3,37,42 namely, for every edge: (i) the number of GO and MSigDB annotations of the two genes delimiting the edge (“richness”); (ii) their coverage in PubMed articles; (iii) their average log-transformed transcriptomic expression across all RNA-sequenced tissues in TCGA; (iv) the percentage of ghost genes, defined as genes in the lower two thirds of the richness distribution; (v) the percentage of ghost genes, defined as genes in the lower two thirds of the PubMed coverage distribution. They were measured by cutting the GNN predicted edges at different thresholds based on the logits in the predicted adjacency matrix, starting from the complete adjacency matrix (no threshold); next moving on to the genes in the top 50,000 highest-ranked predicted edges; then the top 30,000, etc., up to the top 100 (Figure 8).Like in the case of Tabular GhostBuster, once again, the biased source (GO) reported a higher literature-bias burden over the best-performing literature-unbiased source (TCGA) across every explored confounder, thus confirming the hypothesis.

Graph GhostBuster can be utilized to predict gene interactors with modality-specific resolutionSo far, we have established that Graph GhostBuster is effective at predicting gene-gene interactions at full mechanistic granularity, namely distinguishing biological interaction types such as up/downregulation, activation/deactivation, phosphorylation, acetylation, etc. However, the ultimate step is to check whether novel biological insight can be extracted from such predictions.Of note, because the current implementation relies on a classic dot product-based GCN, the output is agnostic of directionality (e.g., A
phosphorylates
B, versus B
phosphorylates
A); however, directionality is usually inferable from the biological background of the two genes (e.g., if B is a kinase, then it is B that phosphorylates
A, and not vice-versa).As an example, let’s consider again alpha-synuclein (αS protein, SNCA gene). Among the top 28 hits for up- or downregulation-related terms (Supplementary Table 5), 18 interactors had already been annotated in the Biology Mega Graph; conversely, 13 of them were novel, including the following:
NOTCH2 (hit for downregulates_quantity in SNCA) encodes one of the notch receptors, which are a cornerstone of the ontogenesis of multiple tissues, including the brain. Interestingly, NOTCH2 has been often found significantly dysregulated in alpha-synucleinopathy patients. For example, a recent transcriptomic panel pinpointed the notch pathway, and specifically NOTCH2, as the most upregulated pathway in PD patients’ blood.107 Likewise, a “major intrinsically disordered NOTCH2-associated receptor 2” (KIAA1024L) was recently identified as a possible central mediator of αS vulnerability, as its knock-out recapitulates many of the PD hallmarks, including specific dopaminergic loss in the substantia nigra.108PTK2 (hit for upregulates_activity in SNCA) encodes protein tyrosine kinase 2, generally known for being a high-level regulator in cell cycle and survival. Interestingly, research from the early 2020’s highlighted a key role in tau- and TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration, with specific focus on vulnerability to the ubiquitin-proteasome system impairment. Kinase inhibitor screening highlighted it as the best neurotoxicity suppressor on a proteasome impairment model109; the mechanism was later identified to involve PTK2’s ability to phosphorylate p62, regulating the p62 pathway which promotes autophagy and misfolded proteins’ turnover.110 While PTK2’s potential role in αS vulnerability has not been investigated yet, it remains extremely plausible based on such background.MLC1 (hit for upregulates_quantity in SNCA) encodes an astrocytic membrane transporter, which has been implicated in astrocyte activation—a key component in the pro-inflammatory mechanisms that are shared across virtually all neurological conditions, including neurodegeneration, stroke, trauma and epilepsy. A specific relation with αS has never been investigated.111As an alternative example, let’s consider TDP-43 (TARDBP gene), which is the central protein in TDP-43 proteinopathies such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the TDP-43 subtype of frontotemporal dementia. Again, among the top 28 hits for up- or downregulation-related terms (Supplementary Table 6), 16 interactors already appeared in the Biology Mega Graph, whereas 12 were novel, for example:
CDKN1A (hit for downregulates_quantity in TARDB) encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which is a direct transcriptional target of p53 and has been implicated in neuronal death. Most notably, a 2018 paper explicitly reported that “expression of Cdkn1 reduces endogenous TDP-43 levels suggesting a reciprocal interaction with TDP-43”112; this matches exactly Graph GhostBuster’s prediction, despite this relation did not appear in the Biology Mega Graph that was used to train it.SMAD3 and SMAD4 (hits for downregulates_activity in TARDB) encode some of the signal transducers of the TGB-β pathways, involved in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Interestingly, a paper reported the accumulation of various SMAD proteins within TDP-43 intracellular inclusions found in the spinal cord of ALS patients, suggesting that TDP-43 accumulation brings about an impairment of the TGF-β pathway.Strikingly, almost all of the novel biological predictions from Graph GhostBuster are biologically interesting, and plausible based on the limited existing literature. These representative examples confirm that Graph GhostBuster is capable of predicting novel biological knowledge, that was not part of its training dataset.In conclusion, the elegance and usefulness of both Tabular and Graph GhostBuster ultimately lie in their unbiased quality: the ability to pinpoint, within an ocean of reported “limited evidence”, which hypotheses are the worthiest of being explored further, making the tool widely adoptable by the biological community.

DiscussionScientific literature suffers from well-known disparity issues, by which it favors a small subgroup of highly annotated genes. Research social structures often encourage investigations to keep focusing on the genes that we already know best, in a sort of “bandwagon effect”.37 Conversely, the (relatively infrequent) efforts to characterize select ghost genes have often led to major scientific breakthroughs. Literature bias also affects computational efforts in the fields of gene function prediction (GFP), gene disease prediction (GDP) and gene network prediction (GNP). Only a small minority of papers take into account the extreme incompleteness in our gene annotation, even in H. sapiens.3,37,42,113 Much ML literature claims to improve prediction accuracy based on ML performance metrics (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, etc.) as if the training target was a perfectly complete ground truth. This observation led us to the following fundamental question, about existing literature—a sort of “self-fulfilling prophecy” hypothesis.By predicting a biased target, based on data that share the same bias (namely, literature bias), is it possible that this short circuit artificially boosts the ML performance, to the point that ML performance metrics may not reflect the actual biological relevance of the predictions?Let’s clarify this question with an example. If both the ML training data and the target are literature-biased, they will contain a mixture of some true and some false statements (e.g., a ghost gene is believed not to play a role in a certain cell function, while in actuality it does); then, a model that yields record-breaking AUC may do so because it better learns the lies as well as the truths. For example, let’s say that gene A has functional annotations f2 and f6; but in actuality, it contributes to f1, f2, f3, f4, f6. If a model predicts f2 and f6, it will score a better AUC than a model that predicts all the real ones. Because ML publications get judged essentially by their prediction’s AUC against the training target, they are encouraged to overfit the errors in the annotations, rather than predict real, novel biology.This issue may also explain why the biological community has shown little trust and adoption of ML-based predictors, despite AUC’s consistently building up in the recent years.4 To tackle this complex bioinformatic question, we developed GhostBuster, to the best of our knowledge the first ML architecture that combines modern deep learning computational firepower with completely literature-unbiased sources for GFP, GDP and GNP.GhostBuster was trained independently on 3 literature-unbiased and 2 biased channels. Remarkably, Tabular GhostBuster’s performance clearly correlated with the amount of bias that was present in the training data, confirming the existence of a short-circuit phenomenon. Subsequent confounder analysis revealed that, in both Tabular and Graph GhostBuster, the use of a biased information channel exacerbated literature bias in the predictions themselves, rendering them less biologically novel, along the lines of “more of what we already know”.The importance of explicitly making this comparison cannot be overstated, as this short circuit phenomenon has never been systematically studied in pre-existing literature, to the best of our knowledge. On the contrary, the performance-boosting effect has been not only accepted, but sometimes even sought after. A notable example is the winner of the recent Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA). CAFA encourages submitters to employ “any other data available to them” to train their models, and judge the models based on the gene annotations that are added to GO in the ~6 months ensuing the deadline.114 However, biocuration comes with a certain delay: evidence is first published in pre-prints, then in literature, and only weeks or months later, it finds its way into the harmonized repositories. If one scraped today’s literature, they would probably be able to anticipate the annotations that will be added to GO in the next weeks or months. This is, in a nutshell, the principle that (explicitly) inspired GOCurator/GORetriever, winner of the CAFA 5 challenge in 2023.115 Indeed, their approach is invaluable to help biocurators harmonize the published literature, yet, it does not aim to add novel biological knowledge. Overall, our analysis on GhostBuster’s performance concluded that ML scores alone are an unsuitable—and sometimes even deceptive—metric for GFP/GDP/GNP tasks, as they may inversely correlate with the biological “interestingness” of the predictions.To provide a better-suited metric, we employed large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini to systematically quantify the degree of association between a gene and each of the 81 phenotypes of interest in Tabular GhostBuster, based on existing literature. Results showed that indeed, models trained from literature-biased data tend to output genes whose involvement in the phenotype was already known in the first place; conversely, unbiased models are considerably less affected by this issue, and generally output a healthy mixture of known genes and novel genes—the latter being the “interesting” ones. Similarly, we employed GPT 4o to generate a list of genes, whose involvement in the phenotype of interest was only discovered between 2022 and 2025; once again, unbiased sources outperformed the biased ones at predicting such genes, by a factor of 2–3×.As far as we are aware, GhostBuster represents the first case in bioinformatic literature where an LLM was utilized for such tasks. One could argue that LLM scoring comes with incomplete accuracy; and indeed, even a small, sampled check in our own LLM results immediately shows that a minority of the LLM’s scoring predictions are incorrect, but they become negligible in such a wide array of queries. We are of the opinion that, by the next few years, systematic LLM scoring across millions of gene-function pairs or gene-disease pairs will become the go-to approach, for every bioinformatic question where manually curated data are not available.Finally, we validated the biological relevance of tabular and Graph GhostBuster by showcasing four applications that may be of interest for a hypothetical, real-world biologist. These are namely: predicting novel genes involved in a function or disease; narrowing down the exact gene’s pathway membership within a broader function; prioritizing the intergenic gene hits from genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and predicting novel gene-gene interactions at full biological granularity. The latter is also largely novel: due to the popularization of “protein-protein interactions” (PPIs) as a general, yet ambiguous term (encompassing anything from physical interactions to phylogeny, coexpression and even indirect transactions), most authors have deployed edge predictors on these broad-scoped networks, rather than exploring them at the level of individual relation types. Across all the manual literature searches that we performed on GhostBuster’s outputs, the top-listers always included a mixture of known and novel genes, where most of the novel ones still offered plausible explanations that supported their potential involvement in the considered cell function, disease, or interactor. This confirms that GhostBuster succeeded in its mission to become the first bioinformatic tool to efficiently prioritize genes on GFP, GDP and GNP tasks, in a literature-agnostic fashion.Tabular GhostBuster architectureThe choice of the ML model was one on which we devoted considerable attention, starting from Tabular GhostBuster. Its task differs from most of the published ones in a fundamental way: most papers predict all (or at least, multiple) gene functions in parallel, rather than one by one. Their target matrix Y is usually made up of hundreds of columns, whereas our Y is just a single column vector.116,117 The reason underlying our choice has to do with cross-validation (CV) stratification. Considering that most of the target classes fall in the 50–200 numerosity range, and that CV is customary for rigorous performance measurement in most GFP and GDP literature,49,51,52 the 10% validation dataset is reduced to as few as 5–20 examples. Stratification is imperative to guarantee that an equal number of examples is present in each fold. For this reason, we made the choice of training an independent model for each of the target phenotypes, even if this comes with substantially higher computational costs.The next question was, how to deal with the fact that our gene prioritization task in Tabular GhostBuster is not a classic positive-negative classification, but rather, a positive-unlabeled one (or alternatively, a hidden positive one).96 Our target is a subset of genes that are positive for certain (the target list), while we do not know if the other genes are true negatives (genes that do not participate in the phenotype) or false negatives (genes that actually participate, but the scientific community has not found out yet); existing data sources such as GO store almost exclusively positive information, while negative information (genes that do not play a role in a phenotype) is extremely limited.96,118 Indeed, there has been recent ML literature providing various adaptations to train deep learning on positive-unlabeled tasks.119 However, these architectures remain a small niche in the ML community, and were not designed to face the exceptionally challenging conditions posed to GhostBuster (extreme unbalance, curse of dimensionality, etc.).One could argue, why not to simply prioritize genes based on the logits from a standard classifier. The problem is that most classifiers are only trained to correctly allocate the examples above versus below the 0.5 threshold—there is no additional drive for the classify to “behave” in any specific way within the [−∞, 0.5) and [0.5, +∞] intervals. However, the one family of architectures that inherently have such drive are the margin-based ones, such as SVMs. These algorithms fit a geometric boundary “around” the known positives, and then quantify the geometric distance (i.e., margin) between each example and the boundary. To combine the power of deep learning with margins—thereby taking the good of both words—we eventually settled on an encoder-decoder combo, where the deep-learning encoder learns a low-dimensionality latent representation of the genes, and the SVM decoder takes over to map these embeddings into margins. Of the 150+ papers that we reviewed in the introduction throughout the GFP and GDP literature (see Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4), only STRING2GO has adopted a similar structure, although claiming different motivations.120As an alternative to SVMs, we could have also utilized ensemble-based models, such as random forests, as others have done; GENIE3 (2010)121; Yan et al. (2010)122; Browne et al. (2015)123; GRN-transformer (2022).124 The idea is that each classifier in the ensemble “votes” on the class label for each example, thus forcing the logits to behave like an actual probability. While this method may work well in proximity to the boundary, it would lose generality for genes that are farther away, making it impossible to tell whether an all-0 gene is reasonably close to the boundary or very far away from it. On these grounds, we gave our preference to SVMs.From a purely formal perspective, despite the use of margins, GhostBuster does not fully address the issue of the positive-unlabeled setting: we are still teaching our model that the negatives are “real negatives”—which is biologically incorrect, as they are technically unlabeled examples. This issue is considerably mitigated by the fact that GhostBuster weighs the positive and the “negative” examples inversely proportionally to their abundance. Indeed, among the ~20,000 non-target genes, there will be some that are positive in biological reality, while we are explicitly teaching the machine that they are reliable negatives. Still, the impact of such wrongful teaching will be in the order of 1/200 of the impact exerted by each of the target members, rendering it negligible. Based on these considerations, we argue that, despite the formally incorrect treatment of the unlabeled examples, from a practical standpoint GhostBuster is a highly optimized compromise. To support this claim, across the wide world of GFP and GDP literature, only a small minority of papers have formally accounted for the unlabeled issue,96,118 while the others have generally not brought up the problem.Graph GhostBuster architectureMoving on to Graph GhostBuster, and its GCN architecture: while GCNs internally utilize an encoder-decoder structure, Graph GhostBuster does not employ margins, thus contradicting the prioritization assumption that we just highlighted. This was a deliberate choice, in order not to overload the—already substantial—technical complexity of training a GNN across as many as 36,000 nodes, with node feature vectors as large as 280,000. It follows that, in the current implementation, any use where Graph GhostBuster’s logits are employed to rank the predicted interactors of a given GOI is formally incorrect, even if, in practice, it still usually outputs sensible results. However, for most biological applications, ranking is not strictly needed. For example, a biologist that is studying αS in microglia may be looking for a novel kinase, expressed in microglia, that has the ability to phosphorylate αS. After intersecting the predicted interactors from the “phosphorylates” model, with the kinases expressed in the microglia, and excluding the already known ones, the list of kinases to be experimentally investigated goes down to just a handful genes, that can be individually checked in the wet lab.Another major limitation is that, due to the use of classic GCNs, the current version of Graph GhostBuster is incapable of distinguishing the subject from the object of a biological action in its output. As exemplified, this information can usually be inferred from the known biology of the involved genes, as long as they are not completely uncharacterized.Both such limitations are to be listed among the future developments of Graph GhostBuster. Firstly, daisy-chaining an SVM with the GCN’s decoder operation in order to output a continuous margin, consistently with Tabular GhostBuster. Secondly, replacing the standard GCN with an architecture that supports directional output, such as PyTorch Geometric’s GATConv (graph attention convolution).Training dataFinally, some considerations are due, regarding the choice of the input data channels: LINCS, TCGA and STRING. The LINCS L1000 dataset offers over 3 million gene expression experiments, where cell cultures were subjected to a variety of stimuli (perturbations); these were aggregated into 1.2 million differential signatures, highlighting the perturbation’s effect over the rest state.78,79 The main strength of this approach lies in the fact that it picks up causative effects, rather than just correlation or association; most perturbations, such as chemical compounds, would activate or block single genes or pathways, thus pinpointing their causal, downstream effects. Another strength is that, while these are not single-cell data, their culture-based setting implies that samples are biologically homogeneous—though mostly in cancerous or immortalized conditions. Conversely, the main drawback lies in the L1000 technique itself, which was designed to prioritize scalability: its intrinsic noise is further exacerbated by the fact that only 978 genes were directly measured, whereas the rest were ML-derived. While LINCS was an interesting attempt for GhostBuster, especially considering that it had never been used for GFP/GDP/GNP purposes before (except for Endeavour, which however did not make use of ML125), such drawbacks took a substantial toll in terms of the ML performance.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) offers the methodological advantages of employing state-of-the-art RNA sequencing across over 25,000 samples, all processed using a standardized protocol. The use of bulk RNA sequencing maximizes sensitivity for weakly expressed genes, and its multi-organ scope empowers it to convey broad pleiotropic information, enhancing GhostBuster’s generalizability. However, the cancerous nature of most samples introduces biological complexity due to both driver and passenger mutations. Unlike LINCS, which often isolates single pathway effects by targeted perturbations, cancer reflects the simultaneous dysregulation of a large number of pathways, and even in the same biopsy cells may come with a diverse set of mutational landscapes, due to cancer heterogeneity. Additionally, due to the bulk approach, shifts in cell type composition (due to cancer, aging, or inflammation) are picked up in the gene count matrices, acting as a confounding variable.Finally, the STRING channel leverages phylogeny, enabling to detect functions that may not be apparent from a merely phenotypic characterization; although not unprecedented, phylogenetic data have been relatively neglected in recent architectures, in favor of catch-all (heavily literature-biased) PPIs. Conversely, the rationale of phylogeny ultimately remains a form of guilt by association, even though literature-unbiased.In conclusion, in this work we introduced GhostBuster, a novel machine learning framework designed to prioritize gene functions, disease associations, and interaction modalities in a literature-unbiased manner. Among the data channels evaluated, TCGA emerged as the most promising, offering minimal literature bias, while still maintaining robust predictive performance—comparable to, or only marginally below, that of heavily literature-biased sources like Gene Ontology. These findings support the adoption of TCGA as the default data channel for GhostBuster and lay the groundwork for scaling the platform into a publicly accessible resource. We envision GhostBuster evolving into the first online repository of literature-unbiased gene prioritizations, enabling researchers to identify and explore “ghost genes” relevant to their specific domains. This repository could be structured into three user-driven channels: (i) physiology-based, for querying genes potentially involved in specific cellular functions or compartments; (ii) disease-based, for identifying novel contributors to complex, polygenic conditions such as neurodegeneration, cancer, and autoimmune disorders; and (iii) gene-centric, for exploring granular interaction networks of individual genes. While experimental validation remains a critical next step, GhostBuster represents a foundational advance in unbiased gene discovery. By enabling systematic exploration of under-characterized genes, it offers a powerful tool for accelerating functional genomics and, ultimately, therapeutic innovation.

Scientific literature suffers from well-known disparity issues, by which it favors a small subgroup of highly annotated genes. Research social structures often encourage investigations to keep focusing on the genes that we already know best, in a sort of “bandwagon effect”.37 Conversely, the (relatively infrequent) efforts to characterize select ghost genes have often led to major scientific breakthroughs. Literature bias also affects computational efforts in the fields of gene function prediction (GFP), gene disease prediction (GDP) and gene network prediction (GNP). Only a small minority of papers take into account the extreme incompleteness in our gene annotation, even in H. sapiens.3,37,42,113 Much ML literature claims to improve prediction accuracy based on ML performance metrics (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, etc.) as if the training target was a perfectly complete ground truth. This observation led us to the following fundamental question, about existing literature—a sort of “self-fulfilling prophecy” hypothesis.

By predicting a biased target, based on data that share the same bias (namely, literature bias), is it possible that this short circuit artificially boosts the ML performance, to the point that ML performance metrics may not reflect the actual biological relevance of the predictions?

Let’s clarify this question with an example. If both the ML training data and the target are literature-biased, they will contain a mixture of some true and some false statements (e.g., a ghost gene is believed not to play a role in a certain cell function, while in actuality it does); then, a model that yields record-breaking AUC may do so because it better learns the lies as well as the truths. For example, let’s say that gene A has functional annotations f2 and f6; but in actuality, it contributes to f1, f2, f3, f4, f6. If a model predicts f2 and f6, it will score a better AUC than a model that predicts all the real ones. Because ML publications get judged essentially by their prediction’s AUC against the training target, they are encouraged to overfit the errors in the annotations, rather than predict real, novel biology.

This issue may also explain why the biological community has shown little trust and adoption of ML-based predictors, despite AUC’s consistently building up in the recent years.4 To tackle this complex bioinformatic question, we developed GhostBuster, to the best of our knowledge the first ML architecture that combines modern deep learning computational firepower with completely literature-unbiased sources for GFP, GDP and GNP.

GhostBuster was trained independently on 3 literature-unbiased and 2 biased channels. Remarkably, Tabular GhostBuster’s performance clearly correlated with the amount of bias that was present in the training data, confirming the existence of a short-circuit phenomenon. Subsequent confounder analysis revealed that, in both Tabular and Graph GhostBuster, the use of a biased information channel exacerbated literature bias in the predictions themselves, rendering them less biologically novel, along the lines of “more of what we already know”.

The importance of explicitly making this comparison cannot be overstated, as this short circuit phenomenon has never been systematically studied in pre-existing literature, to the best of our knowledge. On the contrary, the performance-boosting effect has been not only accepted, but sometimes even sought after. A notable example is the winner of the recent Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA). CAFA encourages submitters to employ “any other data available to them” to train their models, and judge the models based on the gene annotations that are added to GO in the ~6 months ensuing the deadline.114 However, biocuration comes with a certain delay: evidence is first published in pre-prints, then in literature, and only weeks or months later, it finds its way into the harmonized repositories. If one scraped today’s literature, they would probably be able to anticipate the annotations that will be added to GO in the next weeks or months. This is, in a nutshell, the principle that (explicitly) inspired GOCurator/GORetriever, winner of the CAFA 5 challenge in 2023.115 Indeed, their approach is invaluable to help biocurators harmonize the published literature, yet, it does not aim to add novel biological knowledge. Overall, our analysis on GhostBuster’s performance concluded that ML scores alone are an unsuitable—and sometimes even deceptive—metric for GFP/GDP/GNP tasks, as they may inversely correlate with the biological “interestingness” of the predictions.

To provide a better-suited metric, we employed large language models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini to systematically quantify the degree of association between a gene and each of the 81 phenotypes of interest in Tabular GhostBuster, based on existing literature. Results showed that indeed, models trained from literature-biased data tend to output genes whose involvement in the phenotype was already known in the first place; conversely, unbiased models are considerably less affected by this issue, and generally output a healthy mixture of known genes and novel genes—the latter being the “interesting” ones. Similarly, we employed GPT 4o to generate a list of genes, whose involvement in the phenotype of interest was only discovered between 2022 and 2025; once again, unbiased sources outperformed the biased ones at predicting such genes, by a factor of 2–3×.

As far as we are aware, GhostBuster represents the first case in bioinformatic literature where an LLM was utilized for such tasks. One could argue that LLM scoring comes with incomplete accuracy; and indeed, even a small, sampled check in our own LLM results immediately shows that a minority of the LLM’s scoring predictions are incorrect, but they become negligible in such a wide array of queries. We are of the opinion that, by the next few years, systematic LLM scoring across millions of gene-function pairs or gene-disease pairs will become the go-to approach, for every bioinformatic question where manually curated data are not available.

Finally, we validated the biological relevance of tabular and Graph GhostBuster by showcasing four applications that may be of interest for a hypothetical, real-world biologist. These are namely: predicting novel genes involved in a function or disease; narrowing down the exact gene’s pathway membership within a broader function; prioritizing the intergenic gene hits from genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and predicting novel gene-gene interactions at full biological granularity. The latter is also largely novel: due to the popularization of “protein-protein interactions” (PPIs) as a general, yet ambiguous term (encompassing anything from physical interactions to phylogeny, coexpression and even indirect transactions), most authors have deployed edge predictors on these broad-scoped networks, rather than exploring them at the level of individual relation types. Across all the manual literature searches that we performed on GhostBuster’s outputs, the top-listers always included a mixture of known and novel genes, where most of the novel ones still offered plausible explanations that supported their potential involvement in the considered cell function, disease, or interactor. This confirms that GhostBuster succeeded in its mission to become the first bioinformatic tool to efficiently prioritize genes on GFP, GDP and GNP tasks, in a literature-agnostic fashion.

Tabular GhostBuster architectureThe choice of the ML model was one on which we devoted considerable attention, starting from Tabular GhostBuster. Its task differs from most of the published ones in a fundamental way: most papers predict all (or at least, multiple) gene functions in parallel, rather than one by one. Their target matrix Y is usually made up of hundreds of columns, whereas our Y is just a single column vector.116,117 The reason underlying our choice has to do with cross-validation (CV) stratification. Considering that most of the target classes fall in the 50–200 numerosity range, and that CV is customary for rigorous performance measurement in most GFP and GDP literature,49,51,52 the 10% validation dataset is reduced to as few as 5–20 examples. Stratification is imperative to guarantee that an equal number of examples is present in each fold. For this reason, we made the choice of training an independent model for each of the target phenotypes, even if this comes with substantially higher computational costs.The next question was, how to deal with the fact that our gene prioritization task in Tabular GhostBuster is not a classic positive-negative classification, but rather, a positive-unlabeled one (or alternatively, a hidden positive one).96 Our target is a subset of genes that are positive for certain (the target list), while we do not know if the other genes are true negatives (genes that do not participate in the phenotype) or false negatives (genes that actually participate, but the scientific community has not found out yet); existing data sources such as GO store almost exclusively positive information, while negative information (genes that do not play a role in a phenotype) is extremely limited.96,118 Indeed, there has been recent ML literature providing various adaptations to train deep learning on positive-unlabeled tasks.119 However, these architectures remain a small niche in the ML community, and were not designed to face the exceptionally challenging conditions posed to GhostBuster (extreme unbalance, curse of dimensionality, etc.).One could argue, why not to simply prioritize genes based on the logits from a standard classifier. The problem is that most classifiers are only trained to correctly allocate the examples above versus below the 0.5 threshold—there is no additional drive for the classify to “behave” in any specific way within the [−∞, 0.5) and [0.5, +∞] intervals. However, the one family of architectures that inherently have such drive are the margin-based ones, such as SVMs. These algorithms fit a geometric boundary “around” the known positives, and then quantify the geometric distance (i.e., margin) between each example and the boundary. To combine the power of deep learning with margins—thereby taking the good of both words—we eventually settled on an encoder-decoder combo, where the deep-learning encoder learns a low-dimensionality latent representation of the genes, and the SVM decoder takes over to map these embeddings into margins. Of the 150+ papers that we reviewed in the introduction throughout the GFP and GDP literature (see Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4), only STRING2GO has adopted a similar structure, although claiming different motivations.120As an alternative to SVMs, we could have also utilized ensemble-based models, such as random forests, as others have done; GENIE3 (2010)121; Yan et al. (2010)122; Browne et al. (2015)123; GRN-transformer (2022).124 The idea is that each classifier in the ensemble “votes” on the class label for each example, thus forcing the logits to behave like an actual probability. While this method may work well in proximity to the boundary, it would lose generality for genes that are farther away, making it impossible to tell whether an all-0 gene is reasonably close to the boundary or very far away from it. On these grounds, we gave our preference to SVMs.From a purely formal perspective, despite the use of margins, GhostBuster does not fully address the issue of the positive-unlabeled setting: we are still teaching our model that the negatives are “real negatives”—which is biologically incorrect, as they are technically unlabeled examples. This issue is considerably mitigated by the fact that GhostBuster weighs the positive and the “negative” examples inversely proportionally to their abundance. Indeed, among the ~20,000 non-target genes, there will be some that are positive in biological reality, while we are explicitly teaching the machine that they are reliable negatives. Still, the impact of such wrongful teaching will be in the order of 1/200 of the impact exerted by each of the target members, rendering it negligible. Based on these considerations, we argue that, despite the formally incorrect treatment of the unlabeled examples, from a practical standpoint GhostBuster is a highly optimized compromise. To support this claim, across the wide world of GFP and GDP literature, only a small minority of papers have formally accounted for the unlabeled issue,96,118 while the others have generally not brought up the problem.

Graph GhostBuster architectureMoving on to Graph GhostBuster, and its GCN architecture: while GCNs internally utilize an encoder-decoder structure, Graph GhostBuster does not employ margins, thus contradicting the prioritization assumption that we just highlighted. This was a deliberate choice, in order not to overload the—already substantial—technical complexity of training a GNN across as many as 36,000 nodes, with node feature vectors as large as 280,000. It follows that, in the current implementation, any use where Graph GhostBuster’s logits are employed to rank the predicted interactors of a given GOI is formally incorrect, even if, in practice, it still usually outputs sensible results. However, for most biological applications, ranking is not strictly needed. For example, a biologist that is studying αS in microglia may be looking for a novel kinase, expressed in microglia, that has the ability to phosphorylate αS. After intersecting the predicted interactors from the “phosphorylates” model, with the kinases expressed in the microglia, and excluding the already known ones, the list of kinases to be experimentally investigated goes down to just a handful genes, that can be individually checked in the wet lab.Another major limitation is that, due to the use of classic GCNs, the current version of Graph GhostBuster is incapable of distinguishing the subject from the object of a biological action in its output. As exemplified, this information can usually be inferred from the known biology of the involved genes, as long as they are not completely uncharacterized.Both such limitations are to be listed among the future developments of Graph GhostBuster. Firstly, daisy-chaining an SVM with the GCN’s decoder operation in order to output a continuous margin, consistently with Tabular GhostBuster. Secondly, replacing the standard GCN with an architecture that supports directional output, such as PyTorch Geometric’s GATConv (graph attention convolution).

Training dataFinally, some considerations are due, regarding the choice of the input data channels: LINCS, TCGA and STRING. The LINCS L1000 dataset offers over 3 million gene expression experiments, where cell cultures were subjected to a variety of stimuli (perturbations); these were aggregated into 1.2 million differential signatures, highlighting the perturbation’s effect over the rest state.78,79 The main strength of this approach lies in the fact that it picks up causative effects, rather than just correlation or association; most perturbations, such as chemical compounds, would activate or block single genes or pathways, thus pinpointing their causal, downstream effects. Another strength is that, while these are not single-cell data, their culture-based setting implies that samples are biologically homogeneous—though mostly in cancerous or immortalized conditions. Conversely, the main drawback lies in the L1000 technique itself, which was designed to prioritize scalability: its intrinsic noise is further exacerbated by the fact that only 978 genes were directly measured, whereas the rest were ML-derived. While LINCS was an interesting attempt for GhostBuster, especially considering that it had never been used for GFP/GDP/GNP purposes before (except for Endeavour, which however did not make use of ML125), such drawbacks took a substantial toll in terms of the ML performance.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) offers the methodological advantages of employing state-of-the-art RNA sequencing across over 25,000 samples, all processed using a standardized protocol.

However, the cancerous nature of most samples introduces biological complexity due to both driver and passenger mutations. Unlike LINCS, which often isolates single pathway effects by targeted perturbations, cancer reflects the simultaneous dysregulation of a large number of pathways, and even in the same biopsy cells may come with a diverse set of mutational landscapes, due to cancer heterogeneity. Additionally, due to the bulk approach, shifts in cell type composition (due to cancer, aging, or inflammation) are picked up in the gene count matrices, acting as a confounding variable.Finally, the STRING channel leverages phylogeny, enabling to detect functions that may not be apparent from a merely phenotypic characterization; although not unprecedented, phylogenetic data have been relatively neglected in recent architectures, in favor of catch-all (heavily literature-biased) PPIs. Conversely, the rationale of phylogeny ultimately remains a form of guilt by association, even though literature-unbiased.In conclusion, in this work we introduced GhostBuster, a novel machine learning framework designed to prioritize gene functions, disease associations, and interaction modalities in a literature-unbiased manner.

Materials and methodsVirtual LabGhostBuster was created using our Virtual Lab (VLab) ML framework.69 It was developed in Python 3.9.19, using the Anaconda v23.7.4 distribution to manage libraries and environments, and the PyCharm 2022.2.5 (Professional Edition) environment. The ML code relied on the PyTorch (torch) and Scikit-learn (sklearn) frameworks. All training was conducted using Nvidia CUDA126 v12.3.2 to leverage GPU acceleration for computational efficiency.LINCS datasetLibrary of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) 2020 was accessed through the Clue.io data portal of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.78,79 Specifically, level 5 signatures were manually downloaded for all perturbation types (trt_cp, trt_misc, trt_oe, trt_sh, trt_xpr files), alongside their metadata. A total of 3,026,460 transcriptomic measurements and 1,201,944 signatures were retrieved. Next, signatures were filtered according to the quality control metrics included in the signature information, specifically, only those marked as high quality (is_hiq column) were passed; this step brought the number of signatures down to 282,990. Next, namespace conversions were applied. Reads were originally expressed as 12,328 Entrez IDs; these were updated by replacing obsolete IDs with the current ones, and mapped to the namespace of the NCBI Gene repository; 3 Entrez IDs were dropped. Finally, data were aggregated into an object of the MultiOmicDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of only 1 omic (Tx), with 12,325 reads by 282,990 samples.TCGA datasetThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)127 was employed, by aggregating together all RNA-sequencing cases available in the repository. The dataset was accessed through the NIH GDC data portal, version 2.128 Files were filtered by the “experimental strategy” field, selecting “RNA-Seq”; and by the “Data Type” field, selecting “Gene Expression Quantification”. After applying the file selection, a File manifest, Biospecimens manifest, and a Clinical manifest were generated. The number of retrieved samples was 25,259 (November 2024). A dataframe was assembled from the downloaded files: the tpm_unstranded column was used, in line with established transcriptomics guidelines, suggesting to utilize transcripts per million mapped reads, TPM.129,130 Next, namespace conversions were applied: RNAseq data were originally expressed as 60,660 Ensembl IDs; these were demultiplexed into 39,467 Entrez IDs; synonymous IDs were aggregated by sum; all-0 reads were dropped, resulting in 36,027 approved reads. Finally, data were aggregated into an object of the MultiOmicDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of only 1 omic (Tx), with 36,027 reads by 25,259 samples.We applied pre-processing to make data distribution more suitable for ML processing. After mapping genes into the Entrez namespace, we re-applied the normalization by transcripts per million mapped reads (TPM), as recommended by Tx guidelines.129,130 Next, we log-transformed the data to ensure that all reads would occupy the same order of magnitude.
r'=log10(TPM+1)STRING datasetSearch Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) was accessed through the repository’s official website (www.stringdb-downloads.org).76 The file corresponding to H. sapiens (“9606.protein.links.detailed.v12.0.txt.gz”) was manually downloaded from their FTP server. It was expressed in the form of a graph incidence matrix, listing 13,715,404 protein-protein relations in terms of 8 scores: neighborhood, fusion, cooccurence, coexpression, experimental, database, textmining and combined_score. Only neighborhood, fusion, cooccurrence and coexpression were utilized for the sake of training GhostBuster, the others were dropped. Next, namespace conversion was applied. Data were originally expressed as 19,622 Ensembl protein IDs; these were demultiplexed into 19,199 Entrez IDs; synonymous IDs were aggregated by max; this reduced the number of edges to 6,707,960. Next, the incidence matrix was converted into a pseudo-adjacency matrix. First, all relations were duplicated with the two genes (i.e., the departing node and the destination node) swapped, as STRING edges are meant to be non-directional; this increased the number of edges by a factor of 2×. Next, each destination node was multiplexed into 4 “pseudo”-interactors, one for each of the criteria of interest, namely neighborhood, fusion, cooccurrence and coexpression. Next, a dataframe was created, connecting each of the selected 19,093 Entrez IDs to the 19,093 × 4 = 76,372 pseudo-interactors, whereby a given cell in the dataframe would report the interaction score between that row’s gene and that column’s gene, according to that column’s criterion. Next, all-0 rows and columns were dropped. Finally, data were aggregated into an object of the MultiOmicDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of only 1 omic (phylogenomics), with 18,845 reads (the origin nodes) by 49,402 interactor proteins (the receiving nodes-criterion pairs, playing the role of “samples”).GO datasetGene Ontology was accessed through the official website of the repository (www.geneontology.org). The files corresponding to H. sapiens (namely, “goa_human.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_complex.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_isoform.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_rna.gaf.gz”) were manually downloaded from their FTP server, alongside the GO tree structure file (“go-basic.obo”). The tree structure came in the form of an incidence matrix, associating each GO term with other GO terms, while specifying the nature of such relation (is_a, regulates, positively_regulates, negatively_regulates, part_of); specifically, the two columns is_a and part_of are guaranteed to form a directed acyclic graph131; they were the only columns to be utilized for the sake of this dataset, while the other relation types were dropped. The human annotation came in the form of an incidence matrix, associating human genes or proteins and GO terms, with additional metadata such as evidence type and source; specifically, a total of 876,365 relations were listed, involving 812,829 proteins (expressed as Uniprot132 IDs), 54,821 RNA genes (expressed as RNAcentral133 IDs) and 8,725 complexes (expressed as ComplexPortal70 IDs; as the current implementation of GhostBuster focuses on protein-coding genes, only proteins were utilized, while the other entries were dropped. All relation types were included, except those marked as “negative”, as they were too few to be utilized as negative examples for ML (0.17%).Surprisingly, we found that, in the original form of GO, a gene’s membership in a given class did not necessarily imply its membership in the related superclasses—despite GO being described as a hierarchical tree. For example, term GO:0007127 “meiosis I” is a descendent class of GO:0022414 “reproductive process”, but the former includes 21 members (either proteins, RNAs or complexes), while the latter includes only 8, none of which are shared between the two classes. To compensate for this mismatch, GO was “enriched” to guarantee that all member-class pairs would be reflected across all the upstream superclasses, by applying matrix multiplication between the annotation adjacency matrix and the tree structure adjacency matrix. The enrichment increased the number of member-class relations from 474,446 to 3,456,842 (+628.61%).Next, namespace conversion was applied. Data were originally expressed as 85,087 Ensembl protein IDs; these were demultiplexed into 19,237 Entrez IDs; synonymous IDs were aggregated by max; this reduced the number of edges to 1,731,514. Finally, for the sake of training GhostBuster, the incidence matrix was converted into a Boolean adjacency matrix; then, it was converted into an object of the MultiOmicDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of only 1 “pseudo-omic” (GO membership), with 19,237 reads (genes) by 17,873 GO terms (playing the role of “samples”) and a total of 1,731,514 positive values. Of the 19,237 genes, 12,567 were biological processes (BP), 1,760 were cell components (CC) and 3,546 were molecular functions (MF). Conversely, for the sake of using GO classes as a source for target gene lists, the incidence matrix was converted into an object of the OntologyDataset class from our VLab library, with identical properties.Tabular GhostBuster target datasetsIn Tabular GhostBuster, a total of 81 gene lists were used as training targets, which included 54 classes from GO,41 6 classes from the Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI)21 and 21 classes from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).18 The latter were, in turn, originally provided by different repositories, namely: 8 classes from the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways,16 12 classes from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),134 while 1 class included genes from HPO, Biocarta30 and MSigDB itself. Their details can be found in Supplementary Table 1. The GO classes were created by combining one or more membership lists from the GO dataset described in the previous paragraph.MSigDB pathways were accessed through the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) repository of the University of California San Diego and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (www.gsea-msigdb.org).135,136 The entire list of 68 human collections was downloaded, which included, among other things, disease-relevant KEGG, HPO and Biocarta pathway member lists. No namespace conversions were necessary, as the member genes were already expressed in terms of Entrez IDs. A total of 4,058,136 gene-phenotype relations were retrieved, all of which were mapped in the NCBI Gene namespace. Data were aggregated into an object of the OntologyDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of 34,837 classes, 42,494 member genes and 4,058,136 gene-class relations.PheGeni was accessed through the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/phegeni). The “PheGenI_Association_full.tab” file was downloaded from their FTP server. No namespace conversions were necessary, as the member genes were already expressed in terms of Entrez IDs. A total of 106,464 gene-phenotype relations were retrieved; both intragenic and intergenic hits were included; for the latter, the nearest genes were used as a first approximation. Next, gene-phenotype relations were filtered with respect to p-value, selecting for p < 10−8, thus reducing the number of gene-phenotype relations to 17,281; of these, 100 were dropped as their genes did not appear in the NCBI Gene namespace. Data were aggregated into an object of the OntologyDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of 789 classes (diseases), 7,122 member genes and 17,187 gene-class relations.Graph GhostBuster target datasetsIn Graph GhostBuster, a total of 21 gene-gene interaction modalities were used as independent training targets, for a graph edge prediction task. These edges were sourced from the Biology Mega Graph. Their details are depicted in Supplementary Table 2. 11 relational datasets, encompassing gene-gene or miRNA-gene relations, were downloaded from their respective sources and parsed, namely: ComplexPortal,70 human DEPhOsphorylation Database (DEPOD),71 GO,6 MicroT (MirBase and MirGeneDB versions),72 Mirbase,73 NCBI Gene,74 PhosphoSitePlus,75 Signor,36 STRING76 and TarBase.77 GO was parsed as described above. Relation labels underwent manual standardization and curation, to make them cross-compatible across the different data sources. All genes were converted from their original namespaces into the NCBI Entrez namespace, and miRNA names into the miRBase namespace73; unmatched names were dropped; synonymous entries were aggregated by a logical OR. The edge labels were harmonized into a common, fixed vocabulary. The final result was a knowledge graph encompassing 322,255,334 known regulatory relations, among 193,384 gene Entrez IDs and 3,537 miRNAs.Encoder-decoder modelFor all input datasets, and for all target classes, an MLP model (encoder) was trained on a binary classification task, to predict the gene membership status from the input dataset, treating the members of the target class as positive examples (1.0) and the non-members as negative examples (0.0). Genes (examples) were split into 10 cross-validation (CV) folds, each composed of 80% training examples, 10% validation examples and 10% test examples; splitting was conducted in a stratified way, with respect to the target class membership status. The MLP was instantiated from the PyTorch Sequential class; it was trained using the AdamW optimizer, and the BCEWithLogitsLoss loss (sigmoid layer followed by binary cross-entropy). Due to the highly imbalanced target, class weights were applied, which were inversely proportional to their respective abundances. To prevent overfitting, early stopping was employed, based on the Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) in the validation dataset. At each prediction, grid search was automatically conducted by VLab to select the best-performing hyperparameters in the validation set. At the end of the training, latent representations (embeddings) for all genes were generated by feeding the input data into the MLP, and collecting the activation values of the neurons in the second-last layer. Embedding generation was conducted independently for each CV fold. Of note, GhostBuster automatically excludes all input dataset columns that are either identical, a subclass or a superclass to the target one. This is crucial to prevent data leakage, for example, when GhostBuster is trained using the GO channel, while targeting a gene list that is also sourced from GO.Next, a support vector machine (SVM) binary model (decoder) was trained on a binary classification task, to predict the gene membership status from the embeddings, again, treating the members of the target class as positive examples (1.0) and the non-members as negative examples (0.0). The same CV folds were utilized as for the training of the encoder. The SVM was instantiated from the Scikit-learn SVC class. At each prediction, grid search was automatically conducted by VLab to select the best-performing hyperparameters in the validation set; this included retroactively selecting the best hyperparameters in the encoder, that would yield the best performance in the encoder—provided that the CV splits were identical between the two of them. At the end of the training, margins were calculated for each gene, expressing the geometric distance from the hyperplane boundary between the positive and the negative examples.For each grid search epoch, two sets of margins were generated: (1) a test dataset version, which is a concatenation of the model’s output corresponding to the 10% test dataset examples, repeated across the 10 CV folds, so as to cover the entirety of the dataset. Because margins are not directly comparable from one CV fold to another, they were transformed into ranks within each CV fold; as a result, the test dataset margins would include 10 genes ranked as no. 1; 10 genes ranked as no. 2, etc. (2) A full dataset version, which was created by averaging the margins of all genes, across the 10 CV folds; as a result, each gene yielded an average value across 10 predictions: 8 of these predictions were in its capacity of a training dataset example; 1 in its capacity of a validation dataset example; 1 in its capacity of a test dataset example.Graph convolutional neural networkFor all input datasets, and for all interaction modalities, a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) was trained to predict the known gene-gene relations from the input dataset, fed as node features. The graph was represented as a PyTorch Geometric Data object. The known gene-gene relations (edged) served as the positive examples; negative examples were randomly generated, in a 50:1 ratio to the positive ones. The positive and the negative examples were randomly split into a training dataset (80%), a validation dataset (10%) and a test dataset (10%), in a stratified way. The model was instantiated from the PyTorch Geometric GAE (graph autoencoder) class, with the encoder derived from the GCNEncoder class; it was trained in an edge prediction setting, using the AdamW optimizer. Due to the highly imbalanced edge prediction task, class weights were applied, which were inversely proportional to their respective abundances; to achieve this, a manually defined loss was employed, which corresponded to the weighted sum of the correctly classified positive edges and the correctly classified negative edges. To prevent overfitting, early stopping was employed, based on the Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) in the validation dataset. At each prediction, grid search was automatically conducted by VLab to select the best-performing hyperparameters in the validation set. By the end of the training, latent representations (embeddings) for all genes were learned. By subjecting the embeddings to matrix multiplication and sigmoid transformation, a predicted adjacency matrix was generated for the entire graph.Some of the interaction modalities came with a cognate antonymic modality (see Supplementary Table 2); for example, if gene g1 “upregulates quantity” of gene g2, one could assume the opposite to be false, namely that g1 “downregulates quantity” of gene g2 is false; however, this assumption is not always verified, as interactor genes may sometimes yield opposed effects based on the cell type. For the cases where a cognate antonymic modality was available, two models were trained independently:
R model (random negatives), where the negative edges used in training are the randomly generated ones.C model (curated negatives), where the negative edges used in training are the curated ones, that is, the known annotations from the antonymic modality.In both models, no matter whether R or C, ML metrics were independently measured both with respect to the random negatives, and with respect to the curated negatives.Protein-Protein Interaction scoreOne of the control groups of GhostBuster consisted in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) score, which quantified the total number of interactors that a given gene has, that are also members of the target list. STRING was downloaded as described in the previous paragraph. Yet, this time, it was not filtered for any specific column, rather, it was applied “off the shelf”, to simulate its classic use case in the guilt by association paradigm. For each gene-target list pair, the incidence matrix (consisting of 6,707,960 Entrez edges) was filtered for entries that connected either the provided gene with any member of the target list, or vice versa; next, the number of unique in-list partners was counted, and returned as the PPI score for that gene-target list pair. No ML was involved in computing the PPI score, other than the ML that had been used to create the STRING dataset in the first place, by its authors.59PubMed score and richness scoreAnother control group of GhostBuster consisted of two metrics that express how thoroughly annotated a gene is, i.e., where it is positioned along the “ghostliness” spectrum. These metrics are:
Richness score: it expresses the number of annotations in the GO and MSigDB datasets, combined. The GO adjacency matrix was prepared as explained above; likewise, the MSigDB adjacency matrix was prepared as explained above; the two matrices were concatenated; the number of edges (i.e., connections between a gene and a GO/MSigDB class) was counted for every gene; to improve interpretability, the scores were normalized by dividing them by the maximum (achieved by gene TMEM207, with 7,201 annotations) and multiplying them by 1000; as a result, the scores are expressed in a floating-point numeric scale from 0.0 to 1000.0, whereby 0.0 indicates the lack of annotations, and 1000.0 is achieved only by TMEM207.PubMed score: it simply indicates the number of publications about a given gene in the PubMed repository. Because this metric was highly interpretable per se, it was not further normalized; as a result, the scores are expressed in an integer scale from 0 to 11,581, whereby 0 indicates the lack of publications, and the maximum value of 11,581 is only achieved by gene TP53.GPT scoreOne last control group of GhostBuster consisted in the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) score, that is, a standardized quantification of the association degree between a given gene and a “phenotype” of interest—either a cell physiological function, a cell organelle or a disease. Scoring was performed by OpenAI GPT-4o mini.83 For every phenotype, a script interrogated the OpenAI application programming interface (API) by submitting a prompt and a batch of 200 genes, while expecting a structured output made up of a score and a brief motivation. For the minority of genes where OpenAI reported null output, the query was recursively repeated until an output was achieved. The prompt (Supplementary Table 3a) was designed to guarantee objectiveness and reproducibility; the GPT-aided prompt engineering tool on the GPT playground application (platform.openai.com/playground/) was used to optimize the prompt text for this purpose. A total of 2,722,950 phenotype-gene pairs were submitted to GPT-4o mini across ~11,000 requests, spending ~86 million input tokens, for a total cost of $12.53 in input, and $70.39 in output.GPT validation of recently discovered genesTo validate GhostBuster’s predictions, GPT 4o (full version)137 was tasked to make a list of recently discovered genes, for each of the phenotypes of interest. A script was created that, for every phenotype, interrogated the OpenAI API by submitting the phenotype name and a brief description, while expecting a structured output made up of gene identifiers and the literature sources that justified such decision. Again, the prompt (Supplementary Table 3b) was designed to guarantee objectiveness and reproducibility; the GPT-aided prompt engineering tool on the GPT playground application138 was utilized to optimize the prompt text to this end. Tokens and spend was negligible compared to those associated with calculating GPT scores.HardwareAll development was conducted on a high-performance mainframe computer, featuring Nvidia 4090 GPU and Intel i9–14900K 3.20 GHz CPU.

The dataset was accessed through the NIH GDC data portal, version 2.128 Files were filtered by the “experimental strategy” field, selecting “RNA-Seq”; and by the “Data Type” field, selecting “Gene Expression Quantification”. After applying the file selection, a File manifest, Biospecimens manifest, and a Clinical manifest were generated. The number of retrieved samples was 25,259 (November 2024).

STRING datasetSearch Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) was accessed through the repository’s official website (www.stringdb-downloads.org).76 The file corresponding to H. sapiens (“9606.protein.links.detailed.v12.0.txt.gz”) was manually downloaded from their FTP server. It was expressed in the form of a graph incidence matrix, listing 13,715,404 protein-protein relations in terms of 8 scores: neighborhood, fusion, cooccurence, coexpression, experimental, database, textmining and combined_score. Only neighborhood, fusion, cooccurrence and coexpression were utilized for the sake of training GhostBuster, the others were dropped. Next, namespace conversion was applied. Data were originally expressed as 19,622 Ensembl protein IDs; these were demultiplexed into 19,199 Entrez IDs; synonymous IDs were aggregated by max; this reduced the number of edges to 6,707,960. Next, the incidence matrix was converted into a pseudo-adjacency matrix. First, all relations were duplicated with the two genes (i.e., the departing node and the destination node) swapped, as STRING edges are meant to be non-directional; this increased the number of edges by a factor of 2×. Next, each destination node was multiplexed into 4 “pseudo”-interactors, one for each of the criteria of interest, namely neighborhood, fusion, cooccurrence and coexpression. Next, a dataframe was created, connecting each of the selected 19,093 Entrez IDs to the 19,093 × 4 = 76,372 pseudo-interactors, whereby a given cell in the dataframe would report the interaction score between that row’s gene and that column’s gene, according to that column’s criterion.

GO datasetGene Ontology was accessed through the official website of the repository (www.geneontology.org). The files corresponding to H. sapiens (namely, “goa_human.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_complex.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_isoform.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_rna.gaf.gz”) were manually downloaded from their FTP server, alongside the GO tree structure file (“go-basic.obo”). The tree structure came in the form of an incidence matrix, associating each GO term with other GO terms, while specifying the nature of such relation (is_a, regulates, positively_regulates, negatively_regulates, part_of); specifically, the two columns is_a and part_of are guaranteed to form a directed acyclic graph131; they were the only columns to be utilized for the sake of this dataset, while the other relation types were dropped. The human annotation came in the form of an incidence matrix, associating human genes or proteins and GO terms, with additional metadata such as evidence type and source; specifically, a total of 876,365 relations were listed, involving 812,829 proteins (expressed as Uniprot132 IDs), 54,821 RNA genes (expressed as RNAcentral133 IDs) and 8,725 complexes (expressed as ComplexPortal70 IDs; as the current implementation of GhostBuster focuses on protein-coding genes, only proteins were utilized, while the other entries were dropped. All relation types were included, except those marked as “negative”, as they were too few to be utilized as negative examples for ML (0.17%).Surprisingly, we found that, in the original form of GO, a gene’s membership in a given class did not necessarily imply its membership in the related superclasses—despite GO being described as a hierarchical tree. For example, term GO:0007127 “meiosis I” is a descendent class of GO:0022414 “reproductive process”, but the former includes 21 members (either proteins, RNAs or complexes), while the latter includes only 8, none of which are shared between the two classes. To compensate for this mismatch, GO was “enriched” to guarantee that all member-class pairs would be reflected across all the upstream superclasses, by applying matrix multiplication between the annotation adjacency matrix and the tree structure adjacency matrix. The enrichment increased the number of member-class relations from 474,446 to 3,456,842 (+628.61%).Next, namespace conversion was applied. Data were originally expressed as 85,087 Ensembl protein IDs; these were demultiplexed into 19,237 Entrez IDs; synonymous IDs were aggregated by max; this reduced the number of edges to 1,731,514. Finally, for the sake of training GhostBuster, the incidence matrix was converted into a Boolean adjacency matrix; then, it was converted into an object of the MultiOmicDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of only 1 “pseudo-omic” (GO membership), with 19,237 reads (genes) by 17,873 GO terms (playing the role of “samples”) and a total of 1,731,514 positive values. Of the 19,237 genes, 12,567 were biological processes (BP), 1,760 were cell components (CC) and 3,546 were molecular functions (MF). Conversely, for the sake of using GO classes as a source for target gene lists, the incidence matrix was converted into an object of the OntologyDataset class from our VLab library, with identical properties.

Gene Ontology was accessed through the official website of the repository (www.geneontology.org). The files corresponding to H. sapiens (namely, “goa_human.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_complex.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_isoform.gaf.gz”, “goa_human_rna.gaf.gz”) were manually downloaded from their FTP server, alongside the GO tree structure file (“go-basic.obo”). The tree structure came in the form of an incidence matrix, associating each GO term with other GO terms, while specifying the nature of such relation (is_a, regulates, positively_regulates, negatively_regulates, part_of); specifically, the two columns is_a and part_of are guaranteed to form a directed acyclic graph131; they were the only columns to be utilized for the sake of this dataset, while the other relation types were dropped. The human annotation came in the form of an incidence matrix, associating human genes or proteins and GO terms, with additional metadata such as evidence type and source; specifically, a total of 876,365 relations were listed, involving 812,829 proteins (expressed as Uniprot132 IDs), 54,821 RNA genes (expressed as RNAcentral133 IDs) and 8,725 complexes (expressed as ComplexPortal70 IDs; as the current implementation of GhostBuster focuses on protein-coding genes, only proteins were utilized, while the other entries were dropped. All relation types were included, except those marked as “negative”, as they were too few to be utilized as negative examples for ML (0.17%).

Surprisingly, we found that, in the original form of GO, a gene’s membership in a given class did not necessarily imply its membership in the related superclasses—despite GO being described as a hierarchical tree. For example, term GO:0007127 “meiosis I” is a descendent class of GO:0022414 “reproductive process”, but the former includes 21 members (either proteins, RNAs or complexes), while the latter includes only 8, none of which are shared between the two classes. To compensate for this mismatch, GO was “enriched” to guarantee that all member-class pairs would be reflected across all the upstream superclasses, by applying matrix multiplication between the annotation adjacency matrix and the tree structure adjacency matrix. The enrichment increased the number of member-class relations from 474,446 to 3,456,842 (+628.61%).

Next, namespace conversion was applied. Data were originally expressed as 85,087 Ensembl protein IDs; these were demultiplexed into 19,237 Entrez IDs; synonymous IDs were aggregated by max; this reduced the number of edges to 1,731,514.

Of the 19,237 genes, 12,567 were biological processes (BP), 1,760 were cell components (CC) and 3,546 were molecular functions (MF). Conversely, for the sake of using GO classes as a source for target gene lists, the incidence matrix was converted into an object of the OntologyDataset class from our VLab library, with identical properties.

Tabular GhostBuster target datasetsIn Tabular GhostBuster, a total of 81 gene lists were used as training targets, which included 54 classes from GO,41 6 classes from the Phenotype-Genotype Integrator (PheGenI)21 and 21 classes from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).18 The latter were, in turn, originally provided by different repositories, namely: 8 classes from the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways,16 12 classes from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),134 while 1 class included genes from HPO, Biocarta30 and MSigDB itself. Their details can be found in Supplementary Table 1. The GO classes were created by combining one or more membership lists from the GO dataset described in the previous paragraph.MSigDB pathways were accessed through the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) repository of the University of California San Diego and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (www.gsea-msigdb.org).135,136 The entire list of 68 human collections was downloaded, which included, among other things, disease-relevant KEGG, HPO and Biocarta pathway member lists. No namespace conversions were necessary, as the member genes were already expressed in terms of Entrez IDs. A total of 4,058,136 gene-phenotype relations were retrieved, all of which were mapped in the NCBI Gene namespace. Data were aggregated into an object of the OntologyDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of 34,837 classes, 42,494 member genes and 4,058,136 gene-class relations.PheGeni was accessed through the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/phegeni). The “PheGenI_Association_full.tab” file was downloaded from their FTP server. No namespace conversions were necessary, as the member genes were already expressed in terms of Entrez IDs. A total of 106,464 gene-phenotype relations were retrieved; both intragenic and intergenic hits were included; for the latter, the nearest genes were used as a first approximation. Next, gene-phenotype relations were filtered with respect to p-value, selecting for p < 10−8, thus reducing the number of gene-phenotype relations to 17,281; of these, 100 were dropped as their genes did not appear in the NCBI Gene namespace. Data were aggregated into an object of the OntologyDataset class from our VLab library, consisting of 789 classes (diseases), 7,122 member genes and 17,187 gene-class relations.

Graph GhostBuster target datasetsIn Graph GhostBuster, a total of 21 gene-gene interaction modalities were used as independent training targets, for a graph edge prediction task. These edges were sourced from the Biology Mega Graph. Their details are depicted in Supplementary Table 2. 11 relational datasets, encompassing gene-gene or miRNA-gene relations, were downloaded from their respective sources and parsed, namely: ComplexPortal,70 human DEPhOsphorylation Database (DEPOD),71 GO,6 MicroT (MirBase and MirGeneDB versions),72 Mirbase,73 NCBI Gene,74 PhosphoSitePlus,75 Signor,36 STRING76 and TarBase.77 GO was parsed as described above. Relation labels underwent manual standardization and curation, to make them cross-compatible across the different data sources. All genes were converted from their original namespaces into the NCBI Entrez namespace, and miRNA names into the miRBase namespace73; unmatched names were dropped; synonymous entries were aggregated by a logical OR. The edge labels were harmonized into a common, fixed vocabulary. The final result was a knowledge graph encompassing 322,255,334 known regulatory relations, among 193,384 gene Entrez IDs and 3,537 miRNAs.

Encoder-decoder modelFor all input datasets, and for all target classes, an MLP model (encoder) was trained on a binary classification task, to predict the gene membership status from the input dataset, treating the members of the target class as positive examples (1.0) and the non-members as negative examples (0.0). Genes (examples) were split into 10 cross-validation (CV) folds, each composed of 80% training examples, 10% validation examples and 10% test examples; splitting was conducted in a stratified way, with respect to the target class membership status. The MLP was instantiated from the PyTorch Sequential class; it was trained using the AdamW optimizer, and the BCEWithLogitsLoss loss (sigmoid layer followed by binary cross-entropy). Due to the highly imbalanced target, class weights were applied, which were inversely proportional to their respective abundances. To prevent overfitting, early stopping was employed, based on the Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) in the validation dataset. At each prediction, grid search was automatically conducted by VLab to select the best-performing hyperparameters in the validation set. At the end of the training, latent representations (embeddings) for all genes were generated by feeding the input data into the MLP, and collecting the activation values of the neurons in the second-last layer. Embedding generation was conducted independently for each CV fold. Of note, GhostBuster automatically excludes all input dataset columns that are either identical, a subclass or a superclass to the target one. This is crucial to prevent data leakage, for example, when GhostBuster is trained using the GO channel, while targeting a gene list that is also sourced from GO.Next, a support vector machine (SVM) binary model (decoder) was trained on a binary classification task, to predict the gene membership status from the embeddings, again, treating the members of the target class as positive examples (1.0) and the non-members as negative examples (0.0). The same CV folds were utilized as for the training of the encoder. The SVM was instantiated from the Scikit-learn SVC class. At each prediction, grid search was automatically conducted by VLab to select the best-performing hyperparameters in the validation set; this included retroactively selecting the best hyperparameters in the encoder, that would yield the best performance in the encoder—provided that the CV splits were identical between the two of them. At the end of the training, margins were calculated for each gene, expressing the geometric distance from the hyperplane boundary between the positive and the negative examples.For each grid search epoch, two sets of margins were generated: (1) a test dataset version, which is a concatenation of the model’s output corresponding to the 10% test dataset examples, repeated across the 10 CV folds, so as to cover the entirety of the dataset. Because margins are not directly comparable from one CV fold to another, they were transformed into ranks within each CV fold; as a result, the test dataset margins would include 10 genes ranked as no. 1; 10 genes ranked as no. 2, etc. (2) A full dataset version, which was created by averaging the margins of all genes, across the 10 CV folds; as a result, each gene yielded an average value across 10 predictions: 8 of these predictions were in its capacity of a training dataset example; 1 in its capacity of a validation dataset example; 1 in its capacity of a test dataset example.

For all input datasets, and for all target classes, an MLP model (encoder) was trained on a binary classification task, to predict the gene membership status from the input dataset, treating the members of the target class as positive examples (1.0) and the non-members as negative examples (0.0).

Graph convolutional neural networkFor all input datasets, and for all interaction modalities, a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) was trained to predict the known gene-gene relations from the input dataset, fed as node features. The graph was represented as a PyTorch Geometric Data object. The known gene-gene relations (edged) served as the positive examples; negative examples were randomly generated, in a 50:1 ratio to the positive ones. The positive and the negative examples were randomly split into a training dataset (80%), a validation dataset (10%) and a test dataset (10%), in a stratified way. The model was instantiated from the PyTorch Geometric GAE (graph autoencoder) class, with the encoder derived from the GCNEncoder class; it was trained in an edge prediction setting, using the AdamW optimizer. Due to the highly imbalanced edge prediction task, class weights were applied, which were inversely proportional to their respective abundances; to achieve this, a manually defined loss was employed, which corresponded to the weighted sum of the correctly classified positive edges and the correctly classified negative edges. To prevent overfitting, early stopping was employed, based on the Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) in the validation dataset. At each prediction, grid search was automatically conducted by VLab to select the best-performing hyperparameters in the validation set. By the end of the training, latent representations (embeddings) for all genes were learned. By subjecting the embeddings to matrix multiplication and sigmoid transformation, a predicted adjacency matrix was generated for the entire graph.Some of the interaction modalities came with a cognate antonymic modality (see Supplementary Table 2); for example, if gene g1 “upregulates quantity” of gene g2, one could assume the opposite to be false, namely that g1 “downregulates quantity” of gene g2 is false; however, this assumption is not always verified, as interactor genes may sometimes yield opposed effects based on the cell type. For the cases where a cognate antonymic modality was available, two models were trained independently:
R model (random negatives), where the negative edges used in training are the randomly generated ones.C model (curated negatives), where the negative edges used in training are the curated ones, that is, the known annotations from the antonymic modality.In both models, no matter whether R or C, ML metrics were independently measured both with respect to the random negatives, and with respect to the curated negatives.

Protein-Protein Interaction scoreOne of the control groups of GhostBuster consisted in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) score, which quantified the total number of interactors that a given gene has, that are also members of the target list. STRING was downloaded as described in the previous paragraph. Yet, this time, it was not filtered for any specific column, rather, it was applied “off the shelf”, to simulate its classic use case in the guilt by association paradigm. For each gene-target list pair, the incidence matrix (consisting of 6,707,960 Entrez edges) was filtered for entries that connected either the provided gene with any member of the target list, or vice versa; next, the number of unique in-list partners was counted, and returned as the PPI score for that gene-target list pair. No ML was involved in computing the PPI score, other than the ML that had been used to create the STRING dataset in the first place, by its authors.59

PubMed score and richness scoreAnother control group of GhostBuster consisted of two metrics that express how thoroughly annotated a gene is, i.e., where it is positioned along the “ghostliness” spectrum. These metrics are:
Richness score: it expresses the number of annotations in the GO and MSigDB datasets, combined. The GO adjacency matrix was prepared as explained above; likewise, the MSigDB adjacency matrix was prepared as explained above; the two matrices were concatenated; the number of edges (i.e., connections between a gene and a GO/MSigDB class) was counted for every gene; to improve interpretability, the scores were normalized by dividing them by the maximum (achieved by gene TMEM207, with 7,201 annotations) and multiplying them by 1000; as a result, the scores are expressed in a floating-point numeric scale from 0.0 to 1000.0, whereby 0.0 indicates the lack of annotations, and 1000.0 is achieved only by TMEM207.PubMed score: it simply indicates the number of publications about a given gene in the PubMed repository. Because this metric was highly interpretable per se, it was not further normalized; as a result, the scores are expressed in an integer scale from 0 to 11,581, whereby 0 indicates the lack of publications, and the maximum value of 11,581 is only achieved by gene TP53.

GPT scoreOne last control group of GhostBuster consisted in the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) score, that is, a standardized quantification of the association degree between a given gene and a “phenotype” of interest—either a cell physiological function, a cell organelle or a disease. Scoring was performed by OpenAI GPT-4o mini.83 For every phenotype, a script interrogated the OpenAI application programming interface (API) by submitting a prompt and a batch of 200 genes, while expecting a structured output made up of a score and a brief motivation. For the minority of genes where OpenAI reported null output, the query was recursively repeated until an output was achieved. The prompt (Supplementary Table 3a) was designed to guarantee objectiveness and reproducibility; the GPT-aided prompt engineering tool on the GPT playground application (platform.openai.com/playground/) was used to optimize the prompt text for this purpose. A total of 2,722,950 phenotype-gene pairs were submitted to GPT-4o mini across ~11,000 requests, spending ~86 million input tokens, for a total cost of $12.53 in input, and $70.39 in output.

GPT validation of recently discovered genesTo validate GhostBuster’s predictions, GPT 4o (full version)137 was tasked to make a list of recently discovered genes, for each of the phenotypes of interest. A script was created that, for every phenotype, interrogated the OpenAI API by submitting the phenotype name and a brief description, while expecting a structured output made up of gene identifiers and the literature sources that justified such decision. Again, the prompt (Supplementary Table 3b) was designed to guarantee objectiveness and reproducibility; the GPT-aided prompt engineering tool on the GPT playground application138 was utilized to optimize the prompt text to this end. Tokens and spend was negligible compared to those associated with calculating GPT scores.
