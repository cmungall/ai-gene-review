The non-ankyrin C terminus of Ikappa Balpha physically interacts with p53 in 
vivo and dissociates in response to apoptotic stress, hypoxia, DNA damage, and 
transforming growth factor-beta 1-mediated growth suppression.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) suppresses the growth of mink lung 
Mv1Lu epithelial cells, whereas testicular hyaluronidase abolishes the growth 
inhibition. Exposure of Mv1Lu cells to TGF-beta1 rapidly resulted in 
down-regulation of cytosolic IkappaBalpha and hyaluronidase prevented this 
effect, suggesting a possible role of IkappaBalpha in the growth regulation. 
Ectopic expression of wild-type and dominant negative IkappaBalpha prevented 
TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression. Nonetheless, the blocking effect of 
IkappaBalpha is not related to regulation of NF-kappaB function by its 
N-terminal ankyrin-repeat region (amino acids 1-243). Removal of the PEST 
(proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) domain-containing C terminus (amino 
acids 244-314) abolished the IkappaBalpha function, and the C terminus alone 
blocked the TGF-beta1 growth-inhibitory effect. Co-immunoprecipitation by 
anti-p53 antibody using Mv1Lu and other types of cells, as well as rat liver and 
spleen, revealed that a portion of cytosolic IkappaBalpha physically interacted 
with p53. In contrast, Mdm2, an inhibitor of p53, was barely detectable in the 
immunoprecipitates. The cytosolic p53 x IkappaBalpha complex rapidly dissociated 
in response to apoptotic stress, etoposide- and UV-mediated DNA damage, hypoxia, 
and TGF-beta1-mediated growth suppression. Also, a rapid increase in the 
formation of the nuclear p53 x IkappaBalpha complex was observed during exposure 
to etoposide and UV. In contrast, TGF-beta1-mediated promotion of fibroblast 
growth failed to mediate p53 x IkappaBalpha dissociation. Mapping by yeast 
two-hybrid showed that the non-ankyrin C terminus of IkappaBalpha physically 
interacted with the proline-rich region and a phosphorylation site, serine 46, 
in p53. Deletion of serine 46 or alteration of serine 46 to glycine abolished 
the p53 x IkappaBalpha interaction. Alteration to threonine retained the binding 
interaction, suggesting that serine 46 phosphorylation is involved in the p53 x 
IkappaBalpha complex formation. Functionally, enhancement of p53 apoptosis was 
observed when p53 and IkappaBalpha were transiently co-expressed in cells. 
Together, the IkappaBalpha x p53 complex plays an important role in responses 
involving growth regulation, apoptosis, and hypoxic stress.
