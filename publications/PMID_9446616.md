Signal transduction through the interferongamma (IFNgamma) receptor involves the 
formation of a ligand-dependent multimolecular association of receptor chains 
(alpha and beta), Janus tyrosine kinases (Jak1 and Jak2), and the transcription 
factor (signal transducers and activators of transcription 1alpha (STAT1alpha)) 
in addition to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). 
Interactions between components of the Jak/STAT cascade and the 
p21(ras)/Raf-1/MAPK cascade are unexplored. Treatment of HeLa cells with 
IFNgamma resulted in the rapid and transient activation of Raf-1 and MAPK. 
Parallel activation of cells resulted in essentially no enhancement of p21(ras) 
activation despite marked enhancement after treatment with epidermal growth 
factor. In HeLa (E1C3) and fibrosarcoma (U4A) cell lines, both of which are 
deficient in Jak1 kinase, Raf-1 activation by IFNgamma was absent. 
Reconstitution of Raf-1 activity was observed only with kinase active Jak1 in 
both cell lines. In COS cells, transient expression of wild type or 
kinase-inactive Jak1 coimmunoprecipitated with Raf-1, but activation of Raf-1 
activity was only observed in cells expressing kinase-active Jak1. These 
observations suggest that a kinase-active Jak1 is required for IFNgamma 
activation of Raf-1 that is p21(ras)-independent.
