Bioenergetic homeostasis is altered in heart failure and may play an important 
role in pathogenesis. p53 has been implicated in heart failure, and although its 
role in regulating tumorigenesis is well characterized, its activities on 
cellular metabolism are just beginning to be understood. We investigated the 
role of p53 and its transcriptional target gene TP53-induced glycolysis and 
apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) in myocardial energy metabolism under conditions 
simulating ischemia that can lead to heart failure. Expression of p53 and TIGAR 
was markedly upregulated after myocardial infarction, and apoptotic myocytes 
were decreased by 42% in p53-deficient mouse hearts compared with those in 
wild-type mice. To examine the effect of p53 on energy metabolism, cardiac 
myocytes were exposed to hypoxia. Hypoxia induced p53 and TIGAR expression in a 
p53-dependent manner. Knockdown of p53 or TIGAR increased glycolysis with 
elevated fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels and reduced myocyte apoptosis. Hypoxic 
stress decreased phosphocreatine content and the mitochondrial membrane 
potential of myocytes without changes in ATP content, the effects of which were 
prevented by the knockdown of TIGAR. Inhibition of glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose 
blocked these bioenergetic effects and TIGAR siRNA-mediated prevention of 
apoptosis, and, in contrast, overexpression of TIGAR reduced glucose utilization 
and increased apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that p53 and TIGAR inhibit 
glycolysis in hypoxic myocytes and that inhibition of glycolysis is closely 
involved in apoptosis, suggesting that p53 and TIGAR are significant mediators 
of cellular energy homeostasis and cell death under ischemic stress.

## Full Text

IntroductionNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the deposition of fat in the liver. NAFLD is caused by factors such as relative overnutrition, excluding certain established liver injuries and alcohol factors (Riquelme, et al., 2009). As one of the world's top three most prevalent health-threatening liver diseases, the incidence of NAFLD affects around 30 percent of the global population (Lazo and Clark, 2008). In modern intensive livestock production, the prevalence of fatty liver is increased in livestock and poultry due to accelerated breed improvement, high feed levels, and decreased animal activity. Indeed, fatty liver is a significant contributor to problems such as elevated mortality in laying hens, reduced egg production and lower lactation in dairy cows (Abbasi, et al., 2017; Feng, et al., 2023). Fatty liver disease in livestock has a detrimental effect on animal health and welfare, causing significant economic losses in livestock production. The goose fatty liver is a physiological fatty liver, which can increase from eight to ten times heavier than normal liver after feeding, without showing any obvious pathological symptoms (Geng, et al., 2016a; Zhao et al., 2022a). This suggests that goose liver may have developed a unique protective mechanism during long-term biological evolution. Uncovering this mechanism may help to improve the production of goose fatty liver and provide reference for solving the problem of NAFLD in humans and animals.Preliminary data from our laboratory indicates that the expression of some mitochondrial genes is up-regulated in the goose fatty liver (Osman, et al., 2016). In particular, mitochondrial gene expression is closely linked to the development of goose fatty liver. Mitochondria, as highly dynamic organelles, undergo a continuous process of biosynthesis to generate new mitochondria to maintain and restore mitochondrial structure, number, and function in response to increased energy demands and other conditions (Scarpulla, 2008; Zhou, et al., 2021). Mitochondrial biosynthesis is often facilitated by mitochondrial fission. Mitochondrial fission is a complex process in which mitochondria are able to split a mitochondrion into two complete daughter mitochondria at the end of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and mitochondrial protein synthesis (Furukawa, et al., 2024). This is due to the mitochondria's complete genetic information transfer and expression system, which is able to encode a number of important mitochondrial proteins, such as the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex Ⅰ-V (MRCC Ⅰ-V) (Ballinger, et al., 2000; Scarpulla, 2008). Notably, mtDNA also plays an integral role in the homeostasis of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Numerous studies have shown that mtDNA copy number is reduced in a variety of pathological conditions, impairing normal mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to impaired ATP synthesis and consequently mitochondrial dysfunction (Kimata, et al., 2010; Tang, et al., 2017). Hence, the mtDNA is imperative in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. However, the intracellular mitochondrial state is not constant. Mitochondrial biosynthesis and energy metabolism are affected by changes in nutritional status, energy supply and environmental factors. Patients and mammals with NAFLD have been found to have reduced mitochondrial gene expression, morphological changes and dysfunction (Chen, et al., 2020a; Nakamuta, et al., 2005).Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) is a member of transcriptional coactivators family that includes two other members, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta (PGC-1β) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator related protein 1 (PPRC1). As a transcriptional co-activator, PGC-1α can bind to a variety of transcription factors with important roles in mtDNA replication and transcription. Moreover, PGC-1α is an upstream regulator of mitochondrial number and function (Fernandez-Marcos and Auwerx, 2011; Scarpulla, 2011) and PGC-1α is also inextricably linked to mitochondrial energy metabolism. PGC-1α is able to regulate mitochondrial metabolism by modulating mitochondrial biosynthesis, including the synthesis of mitochondrial endomembrane proteins, mtDNA, and mitochondrial enzymes, thereby maintaining a normal energy homeostasis in the cell (Choi, et al., 2018; Lehman, et al., 2000). The expression level of PGC-1α is usually downregulated in patients with NAFLD (Luo, et al., 2021). However, there is relatively limited information on the expression level and function of PGC-1α in goose fatty liver. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of PGC-1α in regulating mitochondria in goose fatty liver.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the deposition of fat in the liver. NAFLD is caused by factors such as relative overnutrition, excluding certain established liver injuries and alcohol factors (Riquelme, et al., 2009). As one of the world's top three most prevalent health-threatening liver diseases, the incidence of NAFLD affects around 30 percent of the global population (Lazo and Clark, 2008). In modern intensive livestock production, the prevalence of fatty liver is increased in livestock and poultry due to accelerated breed improvement, high feed levels, and decreased animal activity. Indeed, fatty liver is a significant contributor to problems such as elevated mortality in laying hens, reduced egg production and lower lactation in dairy cows (Abbasi, et al., 2017; Feng, et al., 2023). Fatty liver disease in livestock has a detrimental effect on animal health and welfare, causing significant economic losses in livestock production. The goose fatty liver is a physiological fatty liver, which can increase from eight to ten times heavier than normal liver after feeding, without showing any obvious pathological symptoms (Geng, et al., 2016a; Zhao et al., 2022a). This suggests that goose liver may have developed a unique protective mechanism during long-term biological evolution. Uncovering this mechanism may help to improve the production of goose fatty liver and provide reference for solving the problem of NAFLD in humans and animals.

Preliminary data from our laboratory indicates that the expression of some mitochondrial genes is up-regulated in the goose fatty liver (Osman, et al., 2016). In particular, mitochondrial gene expression is closely linked to the development of goose fatty liver. Mitochondria, as highly dynamic organelles, undergo a continuous process of biosynthesis to generate new mitochondria to maintain and restore mitochondrial structure, number, and function in response to increased energy demands and other conditions (Scarpulla, 2008; Zhou, et al., 2021). Mitochondrial biosynthesis is often facilitated by mitochondrial fission.

Patients and mammals with NAFLD have been found to have reduced mitochondrial gene expression, morphological changes and dysfunction (Chen, et al., 2020a; Nakamuta, et al., 2005).

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) is a member of transcriptional coactivators family that includes two other members, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-beta (PGC-1β) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator related protein 1 (PPRC1).

However, there is relatively limited information on the expression level and function of PGC-1α in goose fatty liver.

Materials and methodsExperimental animals and sample collectionAll animal protocols performed in this study were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Yangzhou University (permission number: 202103309).Thirty healthy 63-day-old male Landes geese were purchased from Fengxian Landes Goose Breeding Farm (Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China). The geese were selected and randomly divided to a control group and an overfeeding group (15 geese per group). In the overfeeding group, there was a 5-day pre-overfeeding period to allow the geese to adapt to the overfeeding, followed by 19 days of formal overfeeding. The overfeeding procedures and the dietary regimes were carried out according to a pre-laboratory method (Osman, et al., 2016). The control group had free access to water and the same feed. After the 24th days of overfeeding, the geese were euthanized by cervical dislocation and the liver samples were immediately collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then transferred to -80°C for storage.Preparation of goose primary hepatocytesThe goose primary hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as adherent cells from Landes goose embryos after 23 days of incubation according to our laboratory's method (Zhao et al., 2022b). After the cell separation is completed, the number of cells was counted and the cells were diluted with complete culture medium to 1 × 106 cells/mL and placed in 12-well plates. The complete medium was consisted of high glucose DMEM culture medium (DMEM Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 0.02 mL/L epidermal growth factor (PeproTech, London, UK), 10 % fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), and 1 % (100 IU/mL) penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Finally, the plates were incubated in a 5 % CO2 incubator (ThermoForma 3110, Ohio, USA) at 37°C and the medium was renewed after the first 6 h of incubation.Overexpression of Goose PGC-1αOverexpression plasmids were transfected when the growth confluence of goose primary hepatocytes reached 70 %. The pcDNA3.1(+) vector containing the goose PGC-1α (XM_013180770.2) coding sequence (CDS) and the empty vector were designed, isolated, and purified from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The CDS of PGC-1α was found to be 2496 base pairs. The PGC-1α Goose primary hepatocytes that were transformed with empty vectors were taken as controls (control treatment), and with PGC-1α CDS vector was used for overexpression (oePGC-1α treatment). The vectors were transfected using Lipofect5000PM (Cat. 21051, Baidai, Changzhou, China) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Six replicates were used for each treatment. After 6 h of transfection, the culture medium was changed from Opti-MEM (Cat. 31985070, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to complete medium. Cells were harvested for later use after 24 h of culture.RNA interference assayThe small interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed to target the goose PGC-1α CDS, and was generated by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The siRNAs were separately transfected into the goose primary hepatocytes, and cultured in complete medium using jetPRIME®Transfection Reagent (Cat. 101000046, Polyplus-transfection S.A., Illkirch, France) as a transfection medium. Scrambled siRNA was taken as a negative control (control treatment). Six replicates were used for the negative control and RNA interference groups (siPGC-1α treatment). The sequences of the sense and antisense strands of chosen siRNAs targeting goose PGC-1α and its negative control siRNA are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. The primary hepatocytes were harvested after 24 h of culture. The best siRNA was selected based on its ability to suppress PGC-1α expression. After evaluation, the sense strand sequence of the chosen siRNA was 5′-GCUACACUUGUGAUGCCUUTT-3′, while the antisense strand sequence was 5′-AAGGCAUCACAAGUGUAGCTT-3′.DNA isolation and mtDNA copy number quantificationTotal DNA was extracted from liver tissues and the goose primary hepatocytes using DNA Extraction Phenol Reagent (Cat. T0250, Solarbio, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was diluted to 50 ng/μL and deposited at -20°C for use. The mtDNA copy number was quantified by real-time PCR. NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) was used as a marker gene of the mtDNA copy number, and Beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M) was used as a genomic DNA marker.Liver tissue AMP, ADP and ATP contentLiver tissue samples were extracted by ultrasonic extraction with 5 mL of 10 % perchloric acid for 30 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 8,000 rpm/min for 5 min immediately after the reaction. The residue was re-extracted again according to the above procedure and the supernatant was combined. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 6.5 with KOH solution, and the supernatant was diluted to 10 mL with water. Subsequently, the AMP, ADP and ATP contents were determined by liquid chromatography (Agilent 1260, CA, USA) after passing through 0.45 μm microporous filter membrane. The column was Agilent C18 (2.1 mm*100 mm, 1.8 μm). The column temperature was set to 25°C, and a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min was used. The data were collected at 254 nm. The sample injection volume was 2 μL, and the isocratic gradient was used (phosphate buffer: methanol=1000:40).Enzyme content and activity analysisThe ratio of NAD+/NADH (Cat. A114-1-1, Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), and activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex enzymes (Cat. BC0510/ Cat. BC3230/ Cat. BC0940/ Cat. BC3245/ Cat. BC1445, Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (Cat. A022-1-1, Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) (Cat. A021-2-1, Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) in the liver tissues and goose primary hepatocytes were determined by using the kits. The assays were performed with reference to the kit instructions. The levels of NAD+ and NADH were expressed as nmol/g, respectively. In addition, the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex enzymes, SDH and MDH were calculated based on the protein concentration of the tissues and expressed as U/mg protein. Protein concentrations were measured according to the instructions of the BCA Protein Concentration Assay Kit (Cat. P0010, Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of gene expressionTotal RNA isolation from samples of tissues and cells was performed by TRIzol Universal Reagent (Cat. DP424, Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) method. The total RNA concentration and quality were evaluated at 260 nm using an Ultra-micro ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Miulab Instruments Co. Ltd., Hangzhou, China). A total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Hifair® Ⅲ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix for qPCR (gDNA digester plus) (Cat. 11141ES, Yesen Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). Real-time PCR was performed in a QuantStudioTM 3 Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using Hieff® qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (No Rox) (Cat. 11202ES, Yesen Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). The reactions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, and 60°C annealing for 30 s. The relative mRNA expression level of target genes was analysed according to the 2−ΔΔCT method after normalisation against the reference gene of GAPDH gene (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008). Primers were designed according to the online software provided by the NCBI Primer- Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) software (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/, accessed on 9 Jan 2024). Primer sequences of all genes used for RT-qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table 1.Western blot analysisProtein extraction was performed using RIPA lysate (Cat. C1053, Applygen Technologies Inc, Beijing, China) with 1 % protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Cat. P0100, Solarbio, Beijing, China) for protein extraction. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Cat. P0010, Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After denaturation, protein samples were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Cat. IPVH00010, Merck Millipore, USA). Following this, the proteins on the PVDF membrane were blocked with a rapid blocking solution (Cat. P30500, NCM Biotech, China) before antibody incubation. The primary antibody (1:500 (vol: vol)) on a shaker at 4 °C for 14 h, which is followed by incubating with a secondary antibody (1:10,000 (vol: vol)) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, protein bands were detected with a chemiluminescent ECL kit (E41202, Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China) and bands were analysed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The following primary antibodies were used: Mouse antiGAPDH-Loading Control antibody (Cat. BSM-33033M, Bioss Biotechnology, Beijing, China), and mouse monoclonal anti- PGC-1α (Cat. sc-518025, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA). The secondary antibodies used was goat antimouse IgG (Cat. CW0102, CWBIO, Taizhou, China). Proteins were visualized using a Tanon 4600SF Chemiluminescent Imaging System (Tanon Science & Technology Co., Shanghai, China).Statistical analysisThe statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test for two-group comparison. P<0.05 was set as indicative of statistical significance. All values were represented as the means and standard error of the means (SEMs).

Conversely, the activity of MRCC V was significantly lower in goose fatty liver compared to the control group (P<0.05). The levels of ADP and ATP were markedly reduced by overfeeding (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference on AMP and the AMP/ATP ratio between overfed group and control treatment (P>0.05). Furthermore, the NAD+/NADH ratio, the enzyme activities of both SDH and MDH were increased in goose fatty liver (P<0.05).Table 1Effect of Energy metabolism indexes in goose fatty liver.Table 1ItemsGroups1P-valueControlOverfeedingMRCC Ⅰ (U/mg protein)12.86 ± 1.269.88 ± 1.100.104MRCC Ⅱ (U/mg protein)4.25 ± 0.3994.90 ± 0.2380.172MRCC Ⅳ (U/mg protein)11.00 ± 0.9016.86 ± 1.95*0.012MRCC Ⅴ (U/mg protein)116.40 ± 6.26968.80 ± 7.17⁎⁎< 0.001ADP (mg/kg)77.82 ± 3.2438.38 ± 2.46⁎⁎< 0.001AMP (mg/kg)39.68 ± 8.5534.85 ± 0.980.256ATP (mg/kg)33.64 ± 2.0823.94 ± 1.09*0.003AMP/ATP1.20 ± 0.161.47 ± 0.100.192NAD+/NADH1.69 ± 0.563.98 ± 0.41*0.005SDH (U/mg protein)4.70 ± 0.436.94 ± 0.56⁎⁎< 0.001MDH (U/mg protein)3.09 ± 0.103.69 ± 0.25*0.038* denotes P<0.05. ** denotes P<0.01.

DiscussionPGC-1α is a key cofactor in mitochondrial biosynthesis. PGC-1α can bind to NRF1 and act together to regulate mitochondrial biosynthesis by acting on the promoter of the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM, which in turn promotes mtDNA transcription and replication, stimulates mitochondrial proliferation, and ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction (Fontecha-Barriuso, et al., 2020). In this study, we found that the abundance of PGC-1α and genes related to mitochondrial biosynthesis, such as NRF1 and TFAM, in goose fatty liver was significantly higher than that in the control group. Moreover, mitochondrial biosynthesis-related genes were verified at overexpression as well as interference levels in goose primary hepatocytes. The mRNA expression levels of mitochondrial biosynthesis-related genes, which include NRF1, TFAM, and TFB1M, were all significantly increased in primary hepatocytes after overexpression of PGC-1α, whereas the opposite was observed after interference with PGC-1α. Upregulation of NRF1 and TFAM has been reported in PGC-1α overexpression mice, and reduced levels of TFAM and NRF1 protein in PGC-1α-deficient diabetic mice, which corroborate with our study (Choi, et al., 2014; Wu, et al., 2022). According to the present results, it is suggested that the elevated mitochondrial gene expression in goose liver during fat deposition may be induced by increased PGC-1α expression. Besides, the mtDNA copy number is an essential indicator of the normal functioning of the mitochondria (Sun, et al., 2019). The mtDNA copy number reflects mitochondrial biogenesis. In our study, mtDNA copy number was shown to be higher in fatty liver than in control group. This observation was consistent with a previous report by Malik et al. (2019), which found an increase in hepatic mtDNA copy number in the early stages of diet-induced NAFLD. In vitro assays further confirmed that mtDNA copy number was significantly increased in primary goose hepatocytes after PGC-1α overexpression, while mtDNA copy number was significantly reduced after PGC-1α interference. Not coincidentally, mtDNA copy number was significantly higher in adult mice myocytes after overexpression of PGC-1α than in normal cells (Wu, et al., 1999). Other data have shown that silencing PGC-1α using shRNA in primary goat granulosa was able to significantly reduce mtDNA copy number and alter mitochondrial ultrastructure (Zhang, et al., 2016). This suggests that PGC-1α is able to increase the mtDNA copy number and thus maintain normal mitochondrial function in goose fatty liver.PGC-1α is also a key co-transcription factor in mediating mitochondrial energy metabolism. Previous studies have revealed that PGC-1α induces up-regulation of the expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism and mediates changes in the organism's energy requirements in mammals. This process is often accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis (Arany, et al., 2005). We observed that the expression abundance of the mitochondrial energy metabolism-related genes PGC-1β, SIRT3, CYTB and AMPKα was up-regulated in fatty liver. In goose primary hepatocytes, PGC-1β, SIRT3, SIRT5, CYTB and AMPKα mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated after PGC-1α overexpression, whereas PGC-1β, SIRT5 and AMPKα mRNA expression levels were significantly declined after PGC-1α interference. Mice deficient in PGC-1α were noted to cause dysregulation of energy metabolism in several systems (Leone, et al., 2005). Down-regulation of SIRT3 expression in colorectal cancer cells after knockdown of PGC-1α by siRNA (Paku, et al., 2021) is also similar to the results of this study. Among them, increased SIRT3 activity promotes the expression of mitochondria-encoded genes and increases ATP synthesis though the PGC-1α pathway (Zhou, et al., 2014). The regulation of PGC-1α and SIRT3 has been demonstrated to be bidirectional, and PGC-1α activates SIRT3 to regulate cell proliferation and glycolytic metabolism in breast cancer. Furthermore, PGC-1α can bind to the proximal promoter of SIRT3 to activate SIRT3 expression (Giralt, et al., 2011; Kong, et al., 2010), which promotes the regulation of energy metabolism pathways and oxidative stress mechanisms (Bell and Guarente, 2011; Zu et al., 2021). When ATP levels within the cell decrease, PGC-1α, a downstream cofactor of AMPK, is activated to stimulate the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, thereby regulating intracellular energy balance (Chaturvedi Rajnish, et al., 2009). Notably, the mitochondrial respiratory chain on the inner mitochondrial membrane is the main site of energy production. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex is a key component and plays an important role in mitochondrial electron transfer and ATP synthesis. Changes in the activity of the complexes are directly or indirectly influenced by alterations in mitochondrial respiratory function. The findings of the present study indicate a notable increase in MRCC IV activity, but a significant decrease in MRCC V activity in the goose fatty liver. Additionally, the enzyme activities of both MRCC I and MRCC III-V were significantly enhanced after PGC-1α overexpression, and MRCC I was significantly diminished after PGC-1α knockdown in hepatocytes. Arany et al. (2005) also discovered that cardiac mitochondrial enzyme activities were reduced in PGC-1α knockout mice. PGC-1α induction had similar effects in both goose fatty liver and primary hepatocytes. However, certain mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRCCs) are complex in vivo and is not affected by PGC-1α alone. The activity of the respiratory chain may be influenced by various aspects, such as the composition of the mitochondrial complex, the protein content, the state of activity, and the intra-mitochondrial environment, among others. Furthermore, goose primary hepatocytes were isolated from embryos, whereas tissues were obtained from adult geese. The status of these two types of MRCCs may be different. This may also lead to some discrepancies in the data. In general, the AMP/ATP ratio measures the state of energy metabolism in an organism. We measured AMP, ADP and ATP levels as well as the AMP/ATP ratio in goose fatty liver. We found that ADP and ATP levels decreased significantly in goose fatty liver, whereas AMP levels and the AMP/ATP ratio remained unchanged. ATP levels were found to decrease in the early stages of hepatic steatosis in mice, but no inflammation was observed in the liver tissue (Schroder, et al., 2016). Goose fatty liver can reach an 8–10-fold higher weight than the normal liver in a short period after overfeeding. The formation of fatty liver requires a large supply of energy for fatty acid synthesis and cell division and growth. This may be the reason why ATP is instead decreased in fatty liver, despite overfeeding provide a large amount of energy to the cell. However, this does not appear to affect the maintenance of fatty liver homeostasis in geese.Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an important auxiliary factor that is widely present in all living cells. Its oxidized and reduced forms (NAD+ and NADH, respectively) play a crucial role in the electron transport chain (ETC) of metabolic processes. The NAD+/NADH ratio assesses mitochondrial energy status and indicates metabolic activity and normal function (Wenz, 2011). PGC-1α can serve as a downstream gene of the deacetylase family in response to changes in NADH, and AMPK can also alter intracellular homeostasis between NAD+ and NADH (Cantó, et al., 2009). PGC-1α has also been reported to regulate NAD+ in cells, and NAD+ levels are reduced in keratinocytes of PGC-1α knockout mice (Wong, et al., 2022). SIRT3 deacetylation activity is dependent on the properties of NAD+ and is able to sense changes in NAD+ levels, namely SIRT3 enzyme activity is significantly increased when the NAD+/NADH ratio is upregulated (Katsyuba, et al., 2018). We have previously observed that changes in PGC-1α expression can mediate mitochondrial energy metabolism, but whether this is related to NAD+/NADH has not been investigated. To investigate this, we determined the ratio of NAD+ to NADH in goose fatty liver. In the present study, the NAD+/NADH ratio was elevated in goose fatty liver. This is consistent with the results of Titov et al (2016), who found that an elevated NAD+/NADH ratio ameliorated proliferation and metabolic defects caused by damaged mitochondria. At the cellular level, the NAD+/NADH ratio was enhanced in primary hepatocytes overexpressing PGC-1α and decreased after PGC-1α interference. This is in line with Zu et al (2021) who found that overexpression of PGC-1α increased the ratio of NAD+/ NADH in breast cancer cells. We speculate that the fatty liver may be able to sense changes in ATP levels and the NAD+/NADH ratio during the formation process. This process activates PGC-1α, which enhances the expression of genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism and further maintaining normal mitochondrial function. Changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio have long been known to modulate several oxidoreductase activities, including SDH and MDH, major enzymes in the TCA cycle (Abulmeaty, et al., 2023; Revollo, et al., 2007). SDH and MDH can produce large amounts of NADH and FADH2 via the electron transport chain to provide energy for organismal growth and reproduction (Chen et al., 2020b). The results showed that the enzyme activities of SDH and MDH were significantly promoted in goose fatty liver as well as in goose primary hepatocytes after overexpression of PGC-1α, and were significantly attenuated in primary goose hepatocytes after interference with PGC-1α. This suggests that up-regulation of PGC-1α expression increases the activities of oxidative metabolism enzymes and promotes TCA cycling. This means that PGC-1α is involved in many intracellular biological processes in the fatty liver, the most important of which remains the regulation of mitochondrial function. PGC-1α can regulate the expression of genes related to mitochondrial biosynthesis and energy metabolism. PGC-1α can also increase the copy number of mtDNA and the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, thus maintaining the normal metabolic activities of mitochondria. The regulation of the mitochondrial changes by PGC-1α could be an adaptive mechanism of fatty liver to cope with the steatosis.

PGC-1α is a key cofactor in mitochondrial biosynthesis. PGC-1α can bind to NRF1 and act together to regulate mitochondrial biosynthesis by acting on the promoter of the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM, which in turn promotes mtDNA transcription and replication, stimulates mitochondrial proliferation, and ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction (Fontecha-Barriuso, et al., 2020).

Moreover, mitochondrial biosynthesis-related genes were verified at overexpression as well as interference levels in goose primary hepatocytes. The mRNA expression levels of mitochondrial biosynthesis-related genes, which include NRF1, TFAM, and TFB1M, were all significantly increased in primary hepatocytes after overexpression of PGC-1α, whereas the opposite was observed after interference with PGC-1α. Upregulation of NRF1 and TFAM has been reported in PGC-1α overexpression mice, and reduced levels of TFAM and NRF1 protein in PGC-1α-deficient diabetic mice, which corroborate with our study (Choi, et al., 2014; Wu, et al., 2022). According to the present results, it is suggested that the elevated mitochondrial gene expression in goose liver during fat deposition may be induced by increased PGC-1α expression. Besides, the mtDNA copy number is an essential indicator of the normal functioning of the mitochondria (Sun, et al., 2019). The mtDNA copy number reflects mitochondrial biogenesis. In our study, mtDNA copy number was shown to be higher in fatty liver than in control group. This observation was consistent with a previous report by Malik et al. (2019), which found an increase in hepatic mtDNA copy number in the early stages of diet-induced NAFLD. In vitro assays further confirmed that mtDNA copy number was significantly increased in primary goose hepatocytes after PGC-1α overexpression, while mtDNA copy number was significantly reduced after PGC-1α interference. Not coincidentally, mtDNA copy number was significantly higher in adult mice myocytes after overexpression of PGC-1α than in normal cells (Wu, et al., 1999). Other data have shown that silencing PGC-1α using shRNA in primary goat granulosa was able to significantly reduce mtDNA copy number and alter mitochondrial ultrastructure (Zhang, et al., 2016). This suggests that PGC-1α is able to increase the mtDNA copy number and thus maintain normal mitochondrial function in goose fatty liver.

PGC-1α is also a key co-transcription factor in mediating mitochondrial energy metabolism. Previous studies have revealed that PGC-1α induces up-regulation of the expression levels of genes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism and mediates changes in the organism's energy requirements in mammals. This process is often accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis (Arany, et al., 2005). We observed that the expression abundance of the mitochondrial energy metabolism-related genes PGC-1β, SIRT3, CYTB and AMPKα was up-regulated in fatty liver. In goose primary hepatocytes, PGC-1β, SIRT3, SIRT5, CYTB and AMPKα mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated after PGC-1α overexpression, whereas PGC-1β, SIRT5 and AMPKα mRNA expression levels were significantly declined after PGC-1α interference. Mice deficient in PGC-1α were noted to cause dysregulation of energy metabolism in several systems (Leone, et al., 2005). Down-regulation of SIRT3 expression in colorectal cancer cells after knockdown of PGC-1α by siRNA (Paku, et al., 2021) is also similar to the results of this study. Among them, increased SIRT3 activity promotes the expression of mitochondria-encoded genes and increases ATP synthesis though the PGC-1α pathway (Zhou, et al., 2014). The regulation of PGC-1α and SIRT3 has been demonstrated to be bidirectional, and PGC-1α activates SIRT3 to regulate cell proliferation and glycolytic metabolism in breast cancer. Furthermore, PGC-1α can bind to the proximal promoter of SIRT3 to activate SIRT3 expression (Giralt, et al., 2011; Kong, et al., 2010), which promotes the regulation of energy metabolism pathways and oxidative stress mechanisms (Bell and Guarente, 2011; Zu et al., 2021). When ATP levels within the cell decrease, PGC-1α, a downstream cofactor of AMPK, is activated to stimulate the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, thereby regulating intracellular energy balance (Chaturvedi Rajnish, et al., 2009). Notably, the mitochondrial respiratory chain on the inner mitochondrial membrane is the main site of energy production. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex is a key component and plays an important role in mitochondrial electron transfer and ATP synthesis. Changes in the activity of the complexes are directly or indirectly influenced by alterations in mitochondrial respiratory function. The findings of the present study indicate a notable increase in MRCC IV activity, but a significant decrease in MRCC V activity in the goose fatty liver. Additionally, the enzyme activities of both MRCC I and MRCC III-V were significantly enhanced after PGC-1α overexpression, and MRCC I was significantly diminished after PGC-1α knockdown in hepatocytes. Arany et al. (2005) also discovered that cardiac mitochondrial enzyme activities were reduced in PGC-1α knockout mice. PGC-1α induction had similar effects in both goose fatty liver and primary hepatocytes. However, certain mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes (MRCCs) are complex in vivo and is not affected by PGC-1α alone. The activity of the respiratory chain may be influenced by various aspects, such as the composition of the mitochondrial complex, the protein content, the state of activity, and the intra-mitochondrial environment, among others. Furthermore, goose primary hepatocytes were isolated from embryos, whereas tissues were obtained from adult geese. The status of these two types of MRCCs may be different. This may also lead to some discrepancies in the data. In general, the AMP/ATP ratio measures the state of energy metabolism in an organism. We measured AMP, ADP and ATP levels as well as the AMP/ATP ratio in goose fatty liver. We found that ADP and ATP levels decreased significantly in goose fatty liver, whereas AMP levels and the AMP/ATP ratio remained unchanged. ATP levels were found to decrease in the early stages of hepatic steatosis in mice, but no inflammation was observed in the liver tissue (Schroder, et al., 2016). Goose fatty liver can reach an 8–10-fold higher weight than the normal liver in a short period after overfeeding. The formation of fatty liver requires a large supply of energy for fatty acid synthesis and cell division and growth. This may be the reason why ATP is instead decreased in fatty liver, despite overfeeding provide a large amount of energy to the cell. However, this does not appear to affect the maintenance of fatty liver homeostasis in geese.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an important auxiliary factor that is widely present in all living cells. Its oxidized and reduced forms (NAD+ and NADH, respectively) play a crucial role in the electron transport chain (ETC) of metabolic processes. The NAD+/NADH ratio assesses mitochondrial energy status and indicates metabolic activity and normal function (Wenz, 2011). PGC-1α can serve as a downstream gene of the deacetylase family in response to changes in NADH, and AMPK can also alter intracellular homeostasis between NAD+ and NADH (Cantó, et al., 2009). PGC-1α has also been reported to regulate NAD+ in cells, and NAD+ levels are reduced in keratinocytes of PGC-1α knockout mice (Wong, et al., 2022). SIRT3 deacetylation activity is dependent on the properties of NAD+ and is able to sense changes in NAD+ levels, namely SIRT3 enzyme activity is significantly increased when the NAD+/NADH ratio is upregulated (Katsyuba, et al., 2018). We have previously observed that changes in PGC-1α expression can mediate mitochondrial energy metabolism, but whether this is related to NAD+/NADH has not been investigated. To investigate this, we determined the ratio of NAD+ to NADH in goose fatty liver. In the present study, the NAD+/NADH ratio was elevated in goose fatty liver. This is consistent with the results of Titov et al (2016), who found that an elevated NAD+/NADH ratio ameliorated proliferation and metabolic defects caused by damaged mitochondria. At the cellular level, the NAD+/NADH ratio was enhanced in primary hepatocytes overexpressing PGC-1α and decreased after PGC-1α interference. This is in line with Zu et al (2021) who found that overexpression of PGC-1α increased the ratio of NAD+/ NADH in breast cancer cells. We speculate that the fatty liver may be able to sense changes in ATP levels and the NAD+/NADH ratio during the formation process. This process activates PGC-1α, which enhances the expression of genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism and further maintaining normal mitochondrial function. Changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio have long been known to modulate several oxidoreductase activities, including SDH and MDH, major enzymes in the TCA cycle (Abulmeaty, et al., 2023; Revollo, et al., 2007). SDH and MDH can produce large amounts of NADH and FADH2 via the electron transport chain to provide energy for organismal growth and reproduction (Chen et al., 2020b). The results showed that the enzyme activities of SDH and MDH were significantly promoted in goose fatty liver as well as in goose primary hepatocytes after overexpression of PGC-1α, and were significantly attenuated in primary goose hepatocytes after interference with PGC-1α. This suggests that up-regulation of PGC-1α expression increases the activities of oxidative metabolism enzymes and promotes TCA cycling. This means that PGC-1α is involved in many intracellular biological processes in the fatty liver, the most important of which remains the regulation of mitochondrial function. PGC-1α can regulate the expression of genes related to mitochondrial biosynthesis and energy metabolism. PGC-1α can also increase the copy number of mtDNA and the activity of mitochondrial enzymes, thus maintaining the normal metabolic activities of mitochondria. The regulation of the mitochondrial changes by PGC-1α could be an adaptive mechanism of fatty liver to cope with the steatosis.

ConclusionsIn conclusion, the expression of PGC-1α was induced in the fatty liver compared to normal liver. In addition, PGC-1α increased the number of mitochondria and enhanced mitochondrial enzyme activities by influencing the up-regulation of mitochondrial biosynthesis and energy metabolism-related gene expression in the goose fatty liver.
