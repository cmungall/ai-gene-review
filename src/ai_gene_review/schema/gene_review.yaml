description: Schema for gene curation
  Top level entity is a GeneReview, which is about a single gene (and its equivalent swiss-prot entry).
  It contains a high level summary of the gene, plus a review of all existing annotations.
  It also contains a list of core functions, which are GO-CAM-like annotons describing the core evolved
  functions of the gene.

  ActionEnum:
    permissible_values:
      ACCEPT:
        description: Accept the existing annotation as-is, no modifications, and retain as representing the core function of the gene
      KEEP_AS_NON_CORE:
        description: Keep the existing annotation as-is, but mark it as non-core. For pleiotropic genes, this may be the developmental
          processes, or other processes that are not the core function of the gene.
      REMOVE:
        description: Remove the existing annotation, as it is unlikely to be correct based on combined evidence
      MODIFY:
        description: The essence of the annotation is sound, but there are better terms to use (use in combination with proposed_replacement_terms).
          if the term is too general, then MODIFY should be used, with a proposed replacement term for the correct specific function.
          sometimes terms can also be overly specific and contorted, so in some cases you might want to generalize
      MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED:
        description: The term is not entirely wrong, but likely represents an over-annotation of the gene
      UNDECIDED:

          RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS
      PENDING:
        description: The review entry is a stub, and the review has not been completed yet.
      NEW:
        description: This is a proposed annotation, not one that exists in the existing GO annotations. Use this to propose a new annotation
          not covered by the existing GO annotations. Use this conservatively, do not over-annotate, especially for biological process.
          Do not use for indirect or pleiotropic effects. Be sure you have good evidence, this can be from multiple sources.
