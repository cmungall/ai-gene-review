description: 'FGFRL1 is the fifth member of the FGFR family that acts as a non-signaling decoy receptor. It has three extracellular Ig-like domains for binding FGF ligands and heparin, but lacks the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. FGFRL1 functions primarily in ligand sequestration, cell adhesion via constitutive homodimers, and cell-cell fusion. It is essential for kidney development, diaphragm muscle formation, and skeletal development.'

  review:
    summary: FGFRL1 binds FGF ligands through its extracellular Ig-like domains but lacks the intracellular kinase domain for signal transduction. It acts as a decoy receptor that sequesters FGFs without transducing signals.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: While FGFRL1 binds FGF ligands, calling it a "receptor activity" is misleading because it does not transduce signals. A more accurate term would focus on its binding activity.
