description: 'DHCR24 encodes Delta(24)-sterol reductase (also known as seladin-1), the terminal enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis that catalyzes the reduction of the delta-24 double bond of sterol intermediates, primarily converting desmosterol to cholesterol. The enzyme is FAD-dependent, requires NADPH as a cofactor, and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. DHCR24 also confers neuroprotection against oxidative stress and amyloid-beta toxicity. Mutations in DHCR24 cause desmosterolosis, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and elevated desmosterol levels.'

  review:
    summary: 'IBA annotation for cytoplasm is questionable. While DHCR24 may have some cytoplasmic presence, all experimental evidence from multiple studies consistently shows primary localization to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with its catalytic domain facing the cytoplasm [PMID:11007892, PMID:22010141]. The cytoplasmic annotation likely reflects the cytoplasmic orientation of the catalytic domain rather than true cytoplasmic localization.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'This annotation is misleading as it suggests cytoplasmic localization when the protein is actually an integral ER membrane protein with a cytoplasmic-facing catalytic domain. The UniProt record and experimental evidence clearly establish ER membrane as the primary localization [PMID:11007892, PMID:22010141].'
