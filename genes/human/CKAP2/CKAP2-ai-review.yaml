description: 'CKAP2 is a potent microtubule-associated protein that functions as the most powerful known microtubule growth factor and stabilizer. Essential for faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis, CKAP2 promotes microtubule nucleation (~100-fold enhancement), dramatically increases growth rates (~20%), and suppresses catastrophic depolymerization. Required for proper mitotic spindle organization, bipolar spindle assembly, and genomic stability. Cell cycle-regulated protein that peaks at G2/M phase and is degraded by APC/C during mitotic exit.'

  review:
    summary: 'CKAP2 is indeed present in the cytoplasm, particularly during interphase when it is largely diffuse in the cytosol. However, this is a very general localization term that does not capture CKAP2s specific and functionally important localizations. This annotation is correct but not informative.'

  review:
    summary: 'CKAP2 is indeed a cytoskeleton-associated protein, specifically a microtubule-associated protein (MAP). However, this term is too general - the more specific microtubule cytoskeleton term better captures CKAP2s function. This annotation is correct but lacks specificity.'

  review:
    summary: 'PMID:16061649 explicitly states that "In p53-competent cells, Ckap2 does not induce tetraploidy but activates p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis." This demonstrates that CKAP2 overexpression can directly activate apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. However, this is based on overexpression studies and may not represent normal physiological function.'
