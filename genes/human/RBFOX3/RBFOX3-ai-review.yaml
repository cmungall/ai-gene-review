description: RBFOX3 (RNA Binding Protein Fox-1 Homolog 3) is a neuronal-specific RNA-binding
  protein (~314 amino acids) that regulates alternative splicing in the central nervous
  system. Also known as NeuN (Neuronal nuclei antigen), it serves as a definitive
  marker for post-mitotic neurons and is critical for neuronal differentiation, adult
  neurogenesis, and synaptic function. Contains a highly conserved RNA recognition  motif
  (RRM) that binds to UGCAUG sequences in pre-mRNA. Functions both as an activator
  and repressor of alternative  splicing in a position-dependent manner. Alternative
  splicing produces nuclear (~46 kDa) and cytoplasmic (~48 kDa)  isoforms with distinct
  functions. Essential for maintaining excitatory/inhibitory balance in neural circuits.

      decay
    supporting_text: We have tested three individual Rbfox3 proteins in alternative
      splicing assays and find that all of these Rbfox3 protein isoforms repress inclusion
      of the alternative RRM exon, exon 6, of Rbfox2, giving rise to a variant of
      Rbfox2 without a functional RRM

  findings:
  - statement: RBFOX3 is the most compact RBFOX family member with unique structural
      features
    supporting_text: RBFOX3 (312 aa) is the shortest family member, significantly
      smaller than RBFOX1 (397 aa) and RBFOX2 (390 aa). Shows only 6-8% sequence identity
      to RBFOX1/2 in overlapping regions, indicating significant functional specialization
      despite conserved RRM domain
  - statement: RNA Recognition Motif confirms sequence-specific binding capability
    supporting_text: RRM domain (aa 100-175, 76 residues) contains canonical RNP1
      motif (RQMFGQF) at position 116 and experimentally validated RNA interaction
      sites. High content of aromatic and basic residues supports RNA binding function
