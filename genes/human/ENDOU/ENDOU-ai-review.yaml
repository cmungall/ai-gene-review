description: 'Uridylate-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves single-stranded RNA at UU and GU motifs in a Mn2+-dependent manner. Originally misidentified as a serine protease (placental protein 11/PP11), ENDOU is now established as a poly(U)-specific ribonuclease with emerging roles in lipid homeostasis and immune regulation. The enzyme produces 2'',3''-cyclic phosphate termini through a His-His-Lys catalytic triad mechanism. Secreted protein expressed predominantly in placenta (syncytiotrophoblast) and various tumor tissues, with newly discovered functions in downregulating lipolytic gene expression to maintain lipid storage during aging.'

    label: RNA endonuclease activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: 'ACCEPT - Core enzymatic function strongly supported by IBA and confirmed experimentally. This phylogenetically-inferred annotation aligns perfectly with the demonstrated molecular function of ENDOU.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: PMID:18936097 definitively established ENDOU as an RNA endonuclease with Mn2+-dependent activity that cleaves single-stranded RNA at UU and GU dinucleotide motifs, producing 2',3'-cyclic phosphate termini. This core function is strongly supported by phylogenetic analysis.

    label: signal transduction
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000108
  review:
    summary: 'REMOVE - This vague IEA annotation likely derives from obsolete protein family classifications. No direct evidence supports ENDOU involvement in signal transduction pathways. The protein functions as an RNA endonuclease that affects gene expression post-transcriptionally, not through signal transduction.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: No evidence from PMID:18936097, PMID:37803019, or other references supports signal transduction activity. ENDOU functions as an RNA-degrading enzyme, not a signaling molecule.

  review:
    summary: 'MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED - While ENDOU is a secreted protein that passes through the secretory pathway, this annotation implies active participation in vesicle transport mechanisms.

    label: scavenger receptor activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'REMOVE - No evidence supports scavenger receptor activity. This erroneous annotation likely stems from early misidentification of ENDOU as a serine protease or confusion with other placental proteins. ENDOU is an RNA endonuclease, not a receptor.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: PMID:18936097 definitively disproved receptor activity and established ENDOU as an RNA endonuclease. No binding or signaling assays support scavenger receptor function.
