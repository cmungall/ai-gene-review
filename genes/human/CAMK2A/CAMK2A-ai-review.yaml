  label: Homo sapiens
description: 'CAMK2A encodes the alpha subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a multifunctional Ser/Thr protein kinase that serves as a molecular switch in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. CaMKIIα is highly enriched in the brain, particularly at excitatory synapses, where it responds to calcium influx through NMDA receptors. Upon Ca2+/calmodulin binding, the kinase undergoes autophosphorylation at Thr286, generating Ca2+-independent activity that persists after calcium levels return to baseline - effectively storing a molecular memory of synaptic activity. The kinase forms dodecameric holoenzymes that phosphorylate numerous synaptic substrates including glutamate receptors, thereby strengthening synaptic transmission during long-term potentiation. Mutations in CAMK2A cause intellectual disability (MRD53) and are associated with autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its critical role in cognitive development and function.'
