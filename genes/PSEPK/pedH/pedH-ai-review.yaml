description: Lanthanide-dependent pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent alcohol
  dehydrogenase that catalyzes the periplasmic oxidation of a broad range of alcohols
  including linear aliphatic alcohols, aromatic alcohols (especially 2-phenylethanol),
  and secondary alcohols. Central to the 2-phenylethanol degradation (Ped) pathway
  and essential for growth on volatile organic compounds. Requires trivalent lanthanide
  ions (La³⁺, Ce³⁺, Pr³⁺, Nd³⁺, Sm³⁺) for catalytic activity and uses cytochrome c
  as electron acceptor. Functions in transcriptional regulation as part of a lanthanide-sensing
  system that inversely regulates pedH and pedE expression via the PedS2/PedR2 two-component
  system. First described lanthanide-dependent quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase
  in a non-methylotrophic bacterium.

    label: calcium ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: Incorrect annotation. PedH is lanthanide-dependent, not calcium-dependent.
      This annotation likely arose from sequence similarity to other PQQ dehydrogenases.
      PedH requires La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+ etc. for activity, but not Ca2+.

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: Too vague and potentially misleading. PedH is a periplasmic protein,
      not membrane-associated. While it has a signal peptide for periplasmic targeting,
      it is a soluble enzyme in the periplasm, not membrane-bound.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: Accurate but too general. This correctly describes the broad enzymatic
      activity but lacks specificity about the PQQ-dependence and cytochrome c as
      electron acceptor. The more specific term GO:0052934 is present and preferred.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: Less accurate than GO:0042597. While PedH is in the periplasm, this term
      implies specific association with the outer membrane boundary. Bioinformatics
      analysis confirms PedH is a soluble enzyme (no TM regions in mature protein)
      that functions throughout the periplasmic space, not specifically at membrane
      interfaces. The hydrophobic region (aa 6-27) is the signal peptide, cleaved
      upon export.

    label: heme binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: Incorrect annotation. PedH does not bind heme directly. It uses cytochrome
      c550 as an external electron acceptor, but PedH itself is not a heme-containing
      protein. This annotation likely arose from automated inference errors.

    label: periplasmic space
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: Correct and well-supported. PedH has a signal peptide (aa 1-25) directing
      export to periplasm. Bioinformatics analysis confirms no transmembrane regions
      in mature protein - it's a soluble enzyme functioning throughout the periplasmic
      space. Like all PQQ-ADHs (ExaA, PedE, MxaF, XoxF), PedH is freely diffusible
      in periplasm where it oxidizes alcohols and transfers electrons to cytochrome
      c.

    label: metal ion binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: Correct but too general. PedH specifically binds lanthanide ions (La3+,
      Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+) which are essential for activity. This is NOT calcium-dependent
      like other PQQ dehydrogenases. GO lacks a specific lanthanide binding term which
      would be more accurate.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: Excellent and highly specific annotation. This perfectly describes PedH
      function - it is an alcohol dehydrogenase that uses cytochrome c (specifically
      cytochrome c550) as electron acceptor. This is the core molecular function annotation.

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: Perfect annotation. PedH absolutely requires PQQ as a cofactor (1:1 stoichiometry)
      for all catalytic activity. This is well-supported by crystal structure data
      showing specific PQQ binding sites. Core molecular function.

proposed_new_terms:
- proposed_name: lanthanide ion binding
  proposed_definition: Binding to a lanthanide ion, including lanthanum (La3+), cerium
    (Ce3+), praseodymium (Pr3+), neodymium (Nd3+), and samarium (Sm3+). Lanthanides
    are f-block elements with unique chemical properties distinct from transition
    metals.
  justification: Many bacterial enzymes specifically require lanthanides rather than
    calcium or other metals. Current GO only has generic "metal ion binding" which
    fails to capture this specificity.
- proposed_name: lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase activity
  proposed_definition: Catalysis of the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones
    with the concomitant reduction of an electron acceptor, requiring lanthanide ions
    for activity.
  justification: Distinguishes lanthanide-dependent enzymes from calcium-dependent
    PQQ dehydrogenases, which is functionally and evolutionarily significant.
suggested_questions:
- question: What structural features of PedH enable selective binding of lanthanides
    over more abundant calcium ions?
- question: How does lanthanide availability in the environment regulate the expression
    and activity of PedH versus calcium-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases?
- question: What is the electronic basis for the enhanced catalytic efficiency of
    lanthanide-PQQ complexes compared to calcium-PQQ?

    geometry and electronic structure in the active site
