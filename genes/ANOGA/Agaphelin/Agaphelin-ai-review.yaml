  label: Anopheles gambiae
description: 'Agaphelin is a mosquito salivary protein containing a single Kazal domain that functions as a highly selective serine protease inhibitor. It specifically targets neutrophil elastase (ELANE) and proteinase 3 (PRTN3) with high affinity, preventing blood coagulation and inflammatory responses during blood feeding. The protein is secreted in saliva and its expression is significantly upregulated upon Plasmodium falciparum infection, suggesting a role in facilitating parasite transmission. Agaphelin exhibits anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities without causing bleeding complications by preserving hemostasis.'

  review:
    summary: 'While the IPI evidence shows Agaphelin binds to ELANE, this general term is not informative. The specific serine protease inhibitor activity (GO:0004867) better captures the functional significance of this binding.'
