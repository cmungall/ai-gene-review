description: 'Sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate to multiple sesquiterpene products, primarily corvol ether B and corvol ether A. This bacterial-origin terpene synthase was acquired through horizontal gene transfer and produces sesquiterpenes important for fungi-environment interactions. The enzyme requires Mg2+ as a cofactor and contains a conserved DDXXXD motif essential for catalytic activity.'

- term:
    id: GO:0008299
    label: isoprenoid biosynthetic process
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: 'This broad term correctly captures that the enzyme participates in isoprenoid biosynthesis, but a more specific term GO:0051762 (sesquiterpene biosynthetic process) would be more appropriate given that this enzyme specifically produces sesquiterpenes from FPP as characterized in PMID:31239482.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'The enzyme specifically catalyzes sesquiterpene biosynthesis, not general isoprenoid biosynthesis. The UniProt entry clearly states it produces 8 different sesquiterpenes including corvol ethers A and B from farnesyl diphosphate.'

    label: terpene synthase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: 'This general terpene synthase activity term is correct but should be refined to the more specific GO:0010334 (sesquiterpene synthase activity) since this enzyme specifically catalyzes the formation of sesquiterpenes from farnesyl diphosphate with characterized EC numbers 4.2.3.163 and 4.2.3.171.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'The enzyme is specifically a sesquiterpene synthase with well-characterized products (corvol ethers A and B) and assigned EC numbers. The more specific term GO:0010334 accurately reflects its molecular function.'

    label: lyase activity
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: 'This very broad lyase activity term is technically correct but uninformative. The enzyme should be annotated with the more specific GO:0016838 (carbon-oxygen lyase activity, acting on phosphates) or even better GO:0010334 (sesquiterpene synthase activity) which captures its specific catalytic function.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'GO:0016829 is too general for a well-characterized enzyme. The protein specifically catalyzes carbon-oxygen bond cleavage in farnesyl diphosphate, releasing diphosphate and forming sesquiterpenes. The more specific molecular function term GO:0010334 better represents its activity.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000117
  review:
    summary: 'This term correctly describes the mechanistic aspect of the enzyme cleaving the C-O bond in farnesyl diphosphate to release diphosphate. However, the more specific term GO:0010334 (sesquiterpene synthase activity) is preferred as it captures both the mechanism and the specific substrate/product relationship.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'While mechanistically accurate, GO:0016838 is still a parent term that encompasses many different enzymes. The specific molecular function GO:0010334 (sesquiterpene synthase activity) better represents this characterized enzyme with assigned EC numbers 4.2.3.163 and 4.2.3.171.'

  review:
    summary: 'This general metal ion binding term should be replaced with the more specific GO:0000287 (magnesium ion binding) as the UniProt entry clearly states the enzyme binds 3 Mg2+ ions per subunit, with specific binding sites identified at positions 91, 96, 230, 234, and 238.'
    action: MODIFY
    reason: 'The enzyme specifically binds magnesium ions (3 Mg2+ per subunit) as cofactors essential for catalytic activity. The DDXXXD motif at positions 91-96 is important for Mg2+ binding. The more specific term GO:0000287 accurately reflects this characterized binding specificity.'
