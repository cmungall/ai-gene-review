  label: Acetivibrio thermocellus ATCC 27405
description: Non-catalytic cellulosome-anchoring protein that enables efficient cellulose
  degradation by tethering the multi-enzyme cellulosome complex to the bacterial cell
  surface. Contains a Type II cohesin domain that specifically binds the dockerin
  domain of CipA (primary scaffoldin) and 3-4 S-layer homology (SLH) domains that
  mediate non-covalent attachment to cell wall polysaccharides. This anchoring mechanism
  concentrates cellulolytic enzymes at the cell-substrate interface, optimizing cellulose
  hydrolysis through proximity effects and preventing enzyme loss to the medium. Knockout
  studies demonstrate 14-23% reduction in cellulose degradation efficiency, confirming
  its essential role in cell-associated cellulose catabolism.

  review:
    summary: This annotation accurately reflects ancA's role in cellulose degradation
      through its anchoring function. The protein enables polysaccharide catabolism
      by tethering the cellulosome complex to the cell surface, optimizing enzymatic
      access to insoluble cellulose substrates.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: AncA is directly involved in polysaccharide catabolism through its essential
      role in cellulosome anchoring. Mutant studies show reduced cellulose degradation
      rates (~14-23% slower) when ancA is deleted, confirming its contribution to
      the catabolic process. The annotation represents core function.

      supporting_text: deletion and mutant studies underscore the proteins importance
        in cellulose utilization. Strains lacking the ancA-encoded anchor show reduced
        cellulose hydrolysis rates (on the order of ~14–23% slower) and delayed substrate
        degradation

    label: carbohydrate binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This annotation is too general and does not capture the specific molecular
      function of ancA. The protein does not directly bind carbohydrates but rather
      binds protein dockerin domains. The SLH domains may bind cell wall carbohydrates
      for anchoring, but the primary function is protein-protein interaction.
    action: MODIFY
    reason: The term carbohydrate binding is too general and misleading for ancAs
      primary function. AncA specifically binds to dockerin domains of scaffoldins
      (particularly CipAs dockerin) via its Type II cohesin domain. While SLH domains
      may interact with cell wall carbohydrates, the core molecular function is dockerin
      binding, not general carbohydrate binding.

    label: extracellular region
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate but could be more specific. AncA is secreted
      and localized to the cell surface/extracellular region, but more precisely it
      is anchored to the cell wall via SLH domains.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: The protein is secreted with an N-terminal signal peptide and is localized
      to the extracellular region, specifically the cell surface. This is a correct
      but somewhat general annotation that captures the overall cellular location.

      supporting_text: the anchoring protein encoded by ancA is localized to the cell

    label: S-layer
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This annotation is highly accurate. AncA contains multiple S-layer homology
      (SLH) domains that mediate attachment to the cell wall and is localized to the
      S-layer. This represents the precise cellular component location.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: AncA contains three reiterated SLH domains (plus one truncated) that are
      characteristic of S-layer proteins and mediate cell wall attachment. The protein
      is specifically localized to the S-layer as confirmed by biochemical fractionation
      and UniProt annotation. This is a core structural and functional characteristic.

      supporting_text: sequence analysis revealed that the protein contains three
        reiterated C-terminal repeats (~60–70 amino acids each) that are homologous

  review:
    summary: This annotation is accurate and represents the core biological process
      function of ancA. The protein is directly involved in cellulose catabolism by
      anchoring the cellulosome complex that degrades cellulose to the cell surface.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: AncA is directly involved in the cellulose catabolic process through its
      essential role in anchoring the cellulosome to the cell surface. This enables
      efficient cellulose degradation by concentrating cellulases at the substrate
      interface. Knockout studies demonstrate reduced cellulose hydrolysis rates,
      confirming its role in this process. This is a core function.
