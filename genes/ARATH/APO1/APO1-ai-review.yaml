description: APO1 is a chloroplast-localized RNA-binding protein that promotes the splicing of chloroplast group II introns through its zinc-dependent DUF794 RNA-binding domain. It is essential for photosynthetic complex assembly, particularly photosystem I and NADH dehydrogenase complexes, through its role in processing chloroplast transcripts. The protein was initially thought to be directly involved in 4Fe-4S cluster assembly but is now understood to affect these complexes indirectly through its RNA splicing activity.
existing_annotations:
- term:
    id: GO:0003723
    label: RNA binding
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This IBA annotation is well-supported. APO1 contains the DUF794 domain which has been experimentally demonstrated to be an RNA-binding domain with high affinity for RNA in vitro (PMID:21421812). The phylogenetic inference is consistent with the experimental evidence from both Arabidopsis and maize homologs.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function confirmed by direct experimental evidence showing high-affinity RNA binding through the DUF794 domain. This is the primary molecular function enabling its role in chloroplast intron splicing.
- term:
    id: GO:0003723
    label: RNA binding
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000002
  review:
    summary: This automated annotation based on InterPro domain analysis is redundant with the experimental evidence (IDA) and phylogenetic inference (IBA) for the same term. While correct, it adds no additional value.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Redundant with higher-quality evidence (IDA and IBA) for the same function. Automated annotations should be removed when experimental evidence exists.
- term:
    id: GO:0009507
    label: chloroplast
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: This automated annotation is redundant with experimental evidence (IDA) showing chloroplast localization. The IEA annotation should be removed in favor of the experimentally supported annotation.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Redundant with IDA evidence from PMID:15494558 showing chloroplast localization. Automated annotations should be removed when direct experimental evidence exists.
- term:
    id: GO:0009536
    label: plastid
  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000043
  review:
    summary: This annotation to the general term 'plastid' is less specific than the experimentally validated 'chloroplast' localization. Chloroplast is a type of plastid, making this annotation both redundant and less informative.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Redundant and less specific than the chloroplast annotation. APO1 specifically localizes to chloroplasts, not other plastid types. The more specific chloroplast annotation with experimental evidence should be retained.

    label: Group II intron splicing
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:21421812
  review:
    summary: Excellent annotation strongly supported by mutant phenotype analysis. In apo1 mutants, ycf3-intron 2 remains completely unspliced and petD intron splicing is strongly reduced, with several other introns also compromised. This is the core biological process function of APO1.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Direct experimental evidence from mutant analysis showing specific defects in chloroplast group II intron splicing. This represents the primary biological function through which APO1 affects photosystem assembly.

  review:
    summary: Strong direct experimental evidence showing that recombinant APO1 from both Arabidopsis and maize binds RNA with high affinity in vitro. This confirms the molecular function predicted by the DUF794 domain.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Core molecular function with direct experimental validation. The study demonstrated high-affinity RNA binding in vitro, establishing this as the primary molecular function of APO1.

    label: zinc ion binding
  evidence_type: IDA
  original_reference_id: PMID:21421812
  review:
    summary: Well-supported annotation. The DUF794 domain contains zinc finger-like motifs that bind zinc ions, and these are essential for APO1 function. The zinc binding is required for the RNA-binding activity of the protein.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Direct experimental evidence shows DUF794 harbors zinc-binding motifs essential for APO1 function. This represents a core molecular function that enables RNA binding activity.

  original_reference_id: PMID:15494558
  review:
    summary: Experimentally validated chloroplast localization. APO1 contains a transit peptide and was shown to localize to chloroplasts, where it performs its RNA splicing function.
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: Direct experimental evidence for chloroplast localization, consistent with the presence of a transit peptide and the protein's function in chloroplast RNA metabolism.

    label: chloroplast organization
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:15494558
  review:
    summary: While apo1 mutants do show defective chloroplast organization (failure to form grana stacks), this is an indirect consequence of the splicing defects rather than a direct function of APO1. The primary defect is in RNA splicing, which then leads to loss of photosynthetic complexes and consequently abnormal chloroplast structure.
    action: KEEP_AS_NON_CORE
    reason: The chloroplast organization defects are a downstream consequence of impaired group II intron splicing. While the phenotype is real, it represents an indirect effect rather than a core function of APO1.

    label: regulation of gene expression
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:21421812
  review:
    summary: This term is too broad and vague. APO1 specifically promotes chloroplast group II intron splicing, which is already captured by GO:0000373. While RNA splicing is technically a form of gene expression regulation, the more specific term 'Group II intron splicing' better describes the actual function.
    action: REMOVE
    reason: Overly broad term that adds no value beyond the specific 'Group II intron splicing' annotation. The specific splicing function is already well-annotated and this general term obscures the precise molecular mechanism.
- term:
    id: GO:0015979
    label: photosynthesis
  evidence_type: IMP
  original_reference_id: PMID:15494558
  review:
    summary: While apo1 mutants cannot perform photosynthesis, this is an indirect effect of the RNA splicing defects. The loss of photosynthesis results from failure to properly splice chloroplast transcripts encoding photosystem components. APO1 does not directly participate in photosynthesis.
    action: MARK_AS_OVER_ANNOTATED
    reason: Photosynthesis defects are a tertiary consequence - RNA splicing defects lead to loss of photosystem proteins which then impairs photosynthesis. This represents an over-annotation as APO1's direct function is RNA splicing, not photosynthesis itself.
