# Role of Epe1 in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe*: Competing Models of Function

## Introduction

Epe1 is a JmjC domain-containing protein in *Schizosaccharomyces pombe* known for its critical role in heterochromatin regulation[*\[1\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=The%20JmjC%20domain%20is%20conserved,18%5D.%20Epe1%20physically%20interacts). Heterochromatin in fission yeast is characterized by methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me), a mark read by HP1-family proteins (Swi6/Chp2) to enforce gene silencing[*\[2\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Cul4,state%20at%20centromeres%2C%20indicating%20that)*[\[3\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=model%20system%2C%20we%20measured%20the,exhibit%20diffusive%20states%20consistent%20with)*. **Two major models** have been proposed to explain how Epe1 functions in this context:

·  	**Histone Demethylase Model:** Epe1 enzymatically removes methyl groups from H3K9 (and possibly other histone marks), thereby erasing heterochromatic signals and reactivating silenced genes. This model stems from Epe1’s JmjC domain homology to known Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate–dependent histone demethylases[*\[4\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=The%20JmjC%20domain%20is%20conserved,euchromatin%20boundaries%20%5B11%E2%80%9314%5D.%20The).

·  	**Anti-silencing/Chromatin Boundary Model:** Epe1 acts as a *non-enzymatic regulator* of heterochromatin boundaries and stability – for example, by recruiting other chromatin-modifying complexes or by interfering with the binding of silencing factors – rather than by direct demethylation[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions)*[\[6\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,of%20bistable%20heterochromatic%20regions%3F)*. In this view, Epe1 is an “anti-silencing” factor or heterochromatin *destabilizer* that prevents unchecked spread of H3K9me and promotes heterochromatin disassembly at appropriate times[*\[7\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=epigenetically%20diversified%20population%20of%20epe1,functions%3A%20the%20protection%20of%20euchromatic)*[\[8\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=regions%20from%20stochastic%20de%20novo,specific%20H3K9me%20landscapes)*.

Below, we examine each model in detail, highlighting **direct experimental findings** (e.g. enzymatic assays, ChIP-seq profiles, protein interaction studies, genetic knockouts) versus **inferred roles** based on genetic or correlative evidence. We focus on recent peer-reviewed studies (last \~5–10 years) that have refined our understanding of Epe1’s function.

## Epe1 as a Histone Demethylase

Under this model, Epe1 would directly catalyze the removal of methyl groups from methylated histones (specifically H3K9me2/3). Early observations gave credence to this idea: Epe1 overexpression in *S. pombe* cells led to a measurable decrease in H3K9me2 levels at centromeric repeats[*\[2\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Cul4,state%20at%20centromeres%2C%20indicating%20that), accompanied by increased transcription of normally silenced heterochromatic repeats[*\[2\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Cul4,state%20at%20centromeres%2C%20indicating%20that). These results suggested that additional Epe1 can antagonize heterochromatin, consistent with it *removing* the methylation that recruits silencing proteins. Furthermore, *loss* of Epe1 has been associated with **hyper-accumulation of H3K9me** over time. For example, epe1⁻ (null) mutants show elevated H3K9me3 levels in aged cells[*\[9\]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11907270/#:~:text=Our%20study%20reveals%20that%20loss,) and accumulate aberrant small “islands” of H3K9me across euchromatic regions[*\[10\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20suggest%20genome,release%20of%20tethered%20Clr4%2C%20the)*[\[11\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=studies%20suggest%20that%20Epe1%20targets,ectopic%20heterochromatin%20is%20not%20known)*. Such findings imply that Epe1 normally restrains H3K9 methylation levels, as expected for a demethylase.

**Supporting evidence (direct):**

* **JmjC Domain and Homology:** Epe1 contains a JmjC-domain sequence motif, conserved from yeast to humans, which in other proteins confers Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate–dependent demethylase activity[*\[4\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=The%20JmjC%20domain%20is%20conserved,euchromatin%20boundaries%20%5B11%E2%80%9314%5D.%20The). This homology initially led to the hypothesis that Epe1 could specifically demethylate H3K9me, analogous to known JmjC-family demethylases in higher eukaryotes[*\[4\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=The%20JmjC%20domain%20is%20conserved,euchromatin%20boundaries%20%5B11%E2%80%9314%5D.%20The). Structural modeling revealed that Epe1’s JmjC domain is **necessary** for certain Epe1 functions in vivo (discussed below), aligning with an enzymatic role.  
* **Genetic Assays of H3K9me Removal:** Using an *in vivo* heterochromatin assembly/disassembly system, researchers showed that Epe1 can promote H3K9me **demethylation** once heterochromatin has formed. In one study, Clr4 (the H3K9 methyltransferase) was artificially tethered to an euchromatic reporter to induce ectopic heterochromatin; upon releasing Clr4, Epe1’s presence led to a **removal of H3K9me and loss of silencing**, whereas Epe1 deletion caused heterochromatin to persist[*\[12\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=heterochromatin%20formation%20on%20heterochromatin%20assembly,ectopic%20heterochromatin%20is%20not%20known). Notably, this disruption of heterochromatin required Epe1’s JmjC domain[*\[12\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=heterochromatin%20formation%20on%20heterochromatin%20assembly,ectopic%20heterochromatin%20is%20not%20known), suggesting a catalytic demethylation mechanism. Consistently, Sorida et al. (2019) found that **already-established** ectopic heterochromatin patches lost H3K9 methylation only when Epe1’s JmjC domain was intact[*\[13\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Epe1%20prevented%20deposition%20of%20ectopic,provided%20a%20basis%20for%20epigenetic)*[\[7\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=epigenetically%20diversified%20population%20of%20epe1,functions%3A%20the%20protection%20of%20euchromatic)*. The JmjC-mutant Epe1 (catalytically dead) “entirely failed to remove already-established ectopic heterochromatin”[*\[14\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=canonical%20JmjC%20mutant%2C%20suppressed%20red,domain%20mediated%20removal%20of%20H3K9me), indicating that the JmjC domain mediates *active* erasure of H3K9me marks from chromatin that is in a silent state.  
* **Population and Epigenetic Studies:** In the absence of Epe1, cells can adopt heritably silenced states at loci that are normally euchromatic, a phenomenon of **epigenetic diversification***[\[15\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Here%2C%20we%20found%20that%20loss,established%20ectopic)*[\[16\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=results%20show%20that%20Epe1%20has,specific%20H3K9me%20landscapes)*. Sorida et al. showed that *epe1Δ* clones often accumulate stable, ectopic H3K9-methylated domains that resist reactivation[*\[15\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Here%2C%20we%20found%20that%20loss,established%20ectopic). Introducing a single copy of wild-type *epe1+* could erase these ectopic H3K9me marks over successive generations (reflected in restoration of gene expression), whereas an Epe1-H297A mutant (histidine 297 mutated in the JmjC domain, predicted to abolish cofactor binding and demethylase activity) could not efficiently do so[*\[14\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=canonical%20JmjC%20mutant%2C%20suppressed%20red,domain%20mediated%20removal%20of%20H3K9me)*[\[13\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Epe1%20prevented%20deposition%20of%20ectopic,provided%20a%20basis%20for%20epigenetic)*. This **genetic complementation** experiment directly ties Epe1’s presumed catalytic activity to removal of H3K9me in vivo.

**Supporting evidence (indirect/inferential):**

* **H3K9me Balance and Lifespan:** *Epe1* deletion not only increases heterochromatin marks but also confers unusual phenotypes like extended cellular lifespan in yeast[*\[9\]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11907270/#:~:text=Our%20study%20reveals%20that%20loss,). This has been interpreted as a consequence of heightened heterochromatin stability in epe1Δ cells, which might slow aging processes. The inference is that Epe1 normally *prevents* excessive heterochromatin (via demethylation or a similar activity), and in its absence, silencing marks accumulate (possibly beneficially in aging contexts)[*\[9\]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11907270/#:~:text=Our%20study%20reveals%20that%20loss,).  
* **Epistasis with Heterochromatin Factors:** Genetic interactions suggest Epe1 opposes the RNAi-dependent heterochromatin assembly pathway. Deleting *epe1* can bypass the requirement for RNAi in establishing silencing[*\[17\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=promotes%20histone%20turnover%20in%20heterochromatin,Epe1%20may%20therefore%20not%20be), meaning that without Epe1’s removal of marks, even an RNAi mutant can maintain silent chromatin. This scenario is consistent with Epe1’s normal role being to *erase* heterochromatic marks (necessitating continuous RNAi in wild-type cells to counteract Epe1’s activity)[*\[17\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=promotes%20histone%20turnover%20in%20heterochromatin,Epe1%20may%20therefore%20not%20be).

**Contradictory evidence / challenges to the demethylase model:**

Despite the above, **no biochemical assay to date has definitively detected Epe1’s enzymatic activity** on histones:

* **Lack of *in vitro* Demethylase Activity:** Purified Epe1 has been tested in biochemical assays using methylated histone H3 peptides as substrates. These **mass spectrometry-based assays** showed *no detectable removal of methyl groups* by Epe1, either on di-methyl or tri-methyl H3K9 peptides[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions). Even when Epe1 was supplied with its binding partner Swi6 (HP1) in excess – to test if Swi6 could activate a latent enzymatic function – the reactions yielded **no mass shift corresponding to demethylation**, whereas a positive-control enzyme (mammalian JMJD2A, a known H3K9me3 demethylase) readily demethylated the same substrate[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions). This is strong *direct* evidence that Epe1 is catalytically inactive or at least orders of magnitude less active than bona fide demethylases.  
* **Active-Site Degeneration:** Sequence analysis reveals that Epe1’s JmjC domain **lacks critical residues** required for catalytic function. In particular, it does not conserve certain Fe(II)-binding and 2-oxoglutarate-binding amino acids that are universally present in enzymatically active JmjC demethylases[*\[18\]*](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/9Q2YaKn7/#:~:text=Interaction%20of%20Epe1%20With%20the,that%20Swi6%20recruits%20Epe1). *Trewick et al. (2007)* noted “no detectable demethylase activity is associated with Epe1, and its JmjC domain lacks conservation of Fe(II)-binding residues”[*\[18\]*](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/9Q2YaKn7/#:~:text=Interaction%20of%20Epe1%20With%20the,that%20Swi6%20recruits%20Epe1), casting doubt on the protein’s ability to directly catalyze methyl removal. This suggests that, structurally, Epe1 might be a “pseudo-demethylase” – possessing the JmjC fold but not the enzymatic function.  
* **Phenotypic Rescue by Catalytic Mutants:** Some in vivo studies report that mutating Epe1’s putative active-site has little effect on certain phenotypes, implying the enzymatic activity is dispensable. For example, Bao et al. (2019) showed that an Epe1-H297A mutant (catalytically inactive) is still able to perform *anti-silencing* functions such as promoting transcription within heterochromatin[*\[19\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/33/1-2/116.full.pdf#:~:text=,344205)*[\[20\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,2019%29)*. Specifically, neither epe1-H297A nor deletion of the entire JmjC domain abrogated Epe1’s ability to recruit co-activator complexes (see below) and suppress silencing in some contexts[*\[21\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=the%20Clrc%20complex%20responsible%20for,transferase%29%20via%20Epe1%201%20%2831)*[\[22\]](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Concluding%20Remarks%20In%20summary%2C%20our,modifying%20enzymes%20contributes%20to%20disease)*. This indicates that Epe1’s role in heterochromatin can be largely fulfilled without a functional demethylase active site, which contradicts a strict demethylation model.  
* **Incomplete Erasure of Marks:** Even proponents of Epe1’s demethylase activity found it to be **partial**. Sorida et al. reported that while Epe1’s JmjC domain could attack established ectopic heterochromatin, the demethylation was “not 100% effective,” leaving behind a “latent H3K9me source” that could potentially re-initiate silencing[*\[13\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Epe1%20prevented%20deposition%20of%20ectopic,provided%20a%20basis%20for%20epigenetic)*[\[7\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=epigenetically%20diversified%20population%20of%20epe1,functions%3A%20the%20protection%20of%20euchromatic)*. In other words, Epe1 did not fully reverse heterochromatin once formed, which suggests that if it has demethylase activity at all, it is relatively weak or requires cooperation with other factors. This residual heterochromatin implies that additional non-enzymatic mechanisms (or other enzymes) are involved in fully destabilizing silent chromatin.

**Summary of Demethylase Model:** The idea that Epe1 is a **histone H3K9 demethylase** is supported by several *in vivo* observations of Epe1-dependent H3K9me removal and by the necessity of its JmjC domain for certain silencing-reversal phenomena[*\[14\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=canonical%20JmjC%20mutant%2C%20suppressed%20red,domain%20mediated%20removal%20of%20H3K9me)*[\[7\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=epigenetically%20diversified%20population%20of%20epe1,functions%3A%20the%20protection%20of%20euchromatic)*. However, **direct biochemical evidence** for Epe1’s enzymatic activity is conspicuously lacking[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions), and multiple lines of evidence indicate that Epe1 can fulfill its role without catalysis[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions)*[\[18\]](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/9Q2YaKn7/#:~:text=Interaction%20of%20Epe1%20With%20the,that%20Swi6%20recruits%20Epe1)*. As a result, many researchers have shifted away from the notion of Epe1 as a conventional demethylase and toward alternative explanations for its anti-silencing effects[*\[22\]*](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Concluding%20Remarks%20In%20summary%2C%20our,modifying%20enzymes%20contributes%20to%20disease).

## Epe1 as a Non-enzymatic Anti-silencing Factor

In contrast to the above, the **anti-silencing model** posits that Epe1 regulates heterochromatin **through protein-protein interactions and recruitment of other activities**, rather than by directly altering histone methylation via catalysis. Epe1 is often described as a **“boundary element” or “heterochromatin destabilizer”**, meaning it localizes to heterochromatic regions and *prevents the spread or maintenance* of the silent state[*\[23\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=domain,18%5D.%20Epe1%20physically%20interacts)*[\[6\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,of%20bistable%20heterochromatic%20regions%3F)*. Key findings supporting this model revolve around where Epe1 binds in the genome, its interacting partners, and the consequences of its absence or overexpression on chromatin states.

**Supporting evidence (direct):**

* **Localization to Heterochromatin (ChIP-seq):** Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that Epe1 is enriched at heterochromatic regions – notably at **centromeres, telomeres, and the mating-type locus** – often at the *boundaries* of these domains[*\[24\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=View). Genome-wide ChIP-seq profiling confirmed that Epe1 is targeted to sites of H3K9 methylation, and its localization depends largely on the HP1 homolog Swi6[*\[17\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=promotes%20histone%20turnover%20in%20heterochromatin,Epe1%20may%20therefore%20not%20be). Epe1 physically **binds to Swi6/HP1** through its C-terminal region[*\[25\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Swi6%5E%7BHP1%7D%20interacts%20with%20the%20C,proximal%20to%20the%20JmjC%20domain)*[\[26\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=To%20validate%20the%20conclusions%20of,protein%2C%20is%20less%20accessible%20to)*, forming a complex with the very factor that reads H3K9me. This direct binding was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and *in vitro* pull-down assays: a fragment of Epe1 (amino acids 434–948, containing the C-terminus) interacts strongly with Swi6[*\[27\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=two%20C,we%20tested%20the%20interaction%20between)*[\[28\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=assays%20comparing%20the%20interaction%20between,immunoprecipitation%20experiments%20in%20cells)*. Notably, the Epe1–Swi6 interaction is *stimulated by H3K9me* – in vitro experiments showed that methylated histone peptides enhance the binding of Epe1’s C-terminus to Swi6[*\[29\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=paradigm%20where%20a%20putative%20histone,regulate%20the%20assembly%20of%20epigenetic)*[\[30\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=putative%20catalytic%20JmjC%20domain%20of,of%20epigenetic%20complexes%20in%20cells)*. Together, these data indicate that Epe1 is recruited to heterochromatin *via* HP1 bound to methylated nucleosomes, placing Epe1 exactly where it can modulate silent chromatin[*\[24\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=View).  
* **Recruitment of Histone Acetylation Complex (Mass Spectrometry):** A breakthrough study by Bao et al. (2019) revealed that Epe1 can associate with the SAGA co-activator complex[*\[31\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,). By purifying Epe1 from cells (especially when Epe1 was overproduced) and identifying co-purifying proteins (via mass spectrometry), they found subunits of the SAGA complex tightly associated with Epe1[*\[32\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/early/2018/12/20/gad.318030.118.full.pdf#:~:text=protein%20complexes,and%20the)*[\[31\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,)*. SAGA contains histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as Gcn5, which add acetyl groups to histone tails and typically **antagonize heterochromatic silencing**. Bao et al. showed that **overexpressed Epe1 can recruit SAGA to heterochromatic repeats**, resulting in increased histone H3 acetylation and transcriptional reactivation of those repeats[*\[33\]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6317313/#:~:text=,acetylation%2C%20transcription%20of%20repeats%2C)*[\[6\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,of%20bistable%20heterochromatic%20regions%3F)*. Importantly, they demonstrated that this recruitment does **not** require Epe1’s catalytic JmjC function: even a catalytically inactive Epe1 (H297A mutant) could still bind SAGA and promote HAT-dependent chromatin opening[*\[19\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/33/1-2/116.full.pdf#:~:text=,344205)*[\[21\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=the%20Clrc%20complex%20responsible%20for,transferase%29%20via%20Epe1%201%20%2831)*. This provides direct evidence that Epe1’s **primary mechanism is through partnering with other enzymes (like HATs)** to counteract silencing marks.  
* **Association with Bromodomain Factor (ChIP & Interaction):** Another heterochromatin antagonist in fission yeast is Bdf2, a BET-family bromodomain protein that binds acetylated histones. In 2013, Wang et al. found that **Epe1 recruits Bdf2 to heterochromatin boundaries***[\[34\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/27/17/1886.full.html#:~:text=Bdf2%20is%20enriched%20at%20IRCs,H4%20tails%20and%20antagonize). Bdf2 was enriched at boundary elements (e.g. subtelomeric boundary regions called IRCs) only when Epe1 was present, and co-immunoprecipitation indicated Epe1 and Bdf2 interact[*\[34\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/27/17/1886.full.html#:~:text=Bdf2%20is%20enriched%20at%20IRCs,H4%20tails%20and%20antagonize). The bromodomains of Bdf2 recognize acetylated H4 tails and thereby **antagonize H3K9 methylation** spreading[*\[34\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/27/17/1886.full.html#:~:text=Bdf2%20is%20enriched%20at%20IRCs,H4%20tails%20and%20antagonize). Through Epe1, Bdf2 is tethered to the edges of heterochromatic domains, where it likely helps maintain an acetylated, euchromatic state that stops further propagation of silencing[*\[34\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/27/17/1886.full.html#:~:text=Bdf2%20is%20enriched%20at%20IRCs,H4%20tails%20and%20antagonize). This finding aligns well with the SAGA result – in essence, Epe1 appears to marshal **histone acetylation and “pro-euchromatic” activities** to sites of H3K9 methylation, counter-balancing the deacetylation and methylation that produce a silent chromatin state.  
* **Histone Turnover and Chromatin Dynamics:** Epe1 has been implicated in promoting histone turnover within heterochromatin[*\[2\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Cul4,state%20at%20centromeres%2C%20indicating%20that). Turnover (replacement of histones with new ones) can dilute or remove modified histones. By measuring nucleosome dynamics, Bao et al. (2019) observed that Epe1 increases nucleosome turnover rates in heterochromatic regions[*\[35\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=nucleosome%20turnover%20%28Bao%20et%20al,to%C2%A0these%20recent%20studies%20and%20expand). This is a direct *ChIP-seq and sequencing-based* assay outcome suggesting that Epe1 makes heterochromatin less static, possibly by recruiting factors like the FACT complex or nucleosome remodelers. A faster histone turnover would inherently oppose stable H3K9 methylation, effectively “erasing” marks through replacement rather than enzymatic chemistry.  
* **Synthetic Reconstitution Assays:** Raiymbek et al. (2020) took a reductionist approach by tethering heterochromatin components to DNA and examining Epe1’s effect. In an ectopic heterochromatin establishment assay, they artificially targeted Swi6 (HP1) to a reporter locus to induce silencing. When they expressed only the **Epe1 C-terminus** (which binds HP1 but lacks the JmjC domain), it was sufficient to **disrupt heterochromatin assembly** at that locus[*\[36\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=epe1%CE%94%20cells,10X%20tetO%20ade6)*[\[37\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=cells%20that%20harbor%2010X%20TetO,Error%20bars%20represent%20standard)*. Cells carrying just Epe1’s HP1-binding fragment remained unsilenced (“white” colonies in a variegation assay) even under conditions that normally promote silencing[*\[38\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=of%20Epe1%20activity,of%20an%20ade6%2B%20reporter%20gene)*[\[37\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=cells%20that%20harbor%2010X%20TetO,Error%20bars%20represent%20standard)*. Correspondingly, H3K9me2 levels at the reporter were significantly lower when the Epe1 C-terminus was present[*\[37\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=cells%20that%20harbor%2010X%20TetO,Error%20bars%20represent%20standard). This *direct experimental evidence* shows that **Epe1 can counter heterochromatin formation without any catalytic activity**, simply by virtue of its ability to bind HP1 and presumably block or displace other heterochromatin factors (such as Clr3, a histone deacetylase, which competes for binding HP1). In fact, the authors found that adding Swi6/HP1 in vitro **disrupts an intramolecular interaction** between Epe1’s N-terminus and C-terminus, suggesting Epe1’s HP1-binding C-tail is normally autoinhibited by the JmjC-containing region[*\[39\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20C,immunoprecipitation%20experiments%20in%20cells)*[\[40\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%5E%7B434,epe1%20locus%20is%20at%20least)*. This implies a regulatory mechanism: Epe1 might be kept partially inactive until it encounters Swi6-bound nucleosomes, whereupon it opens and competes for binding, thereby **inhibiting the HP1–HDAC (Clr3) interaction** that is needed to maintain silencing[*\[30\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=putative%20catalytic%20JmjC%20domain%20of,of%20epigenetic%20complexes%20in%20cells)*[\[41\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=activity.%20The%20C,of%20epigenetic%20complexes%20in%20cells)*. This steric or competitive mode of action is entirely non-enzymatic.

**Supporting evidence (indirect or correlative):**

* **Variegation and Heterochromatin Spreading Phenotypes:** *Epe1* was first identified genetically as an “anti-silencing” factor at heterochromatin boundaries[*\[1\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=The%20JmjC%20domain%20is%20conserved,18%5D.%20Epe1%20physically%20interacts). *Zofall & Grewal (2006)* showed that deleting *epe1+* causes silent heterochromatin to spread into normally active regions, turning boundary-proximal genes off (analogous to Position Effect Variegation)[*\[42\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,). Conversely, overexpression of Epe1 leads to *desilencing* of heterochromatic reporters (cells show more red/white sectored colonies rather than solid red, indicating instability of silencing)[*\[14\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=canonical%20JmjC%20mutant%2C%20suppressed%20red,domain%20mediated%20removal%20of%20H3K9me)*[\[43\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=processes%20warrant%20further%20investigation,stochastic%20ectopic%20heterochromatin%20formation%20genome)*. These classic epigenetic assays infer that Epe1’s presence at chromatin boundaries prevents the nucleation or propagation of heterochromatin, consistent with a boundary element function. The **N-terminal half of Epe1** was recently found to carry a **transcriptional activation (NTA) domain** that contributes to this anti-silencing effect[*\[44\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=from%20its%20JmjC%20domain%2C%20which,epe1%20%CE%94%20clones%20harboring%20ectopic)*[\[43\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=processes%20warrant%20further%20investigation,stochastic%20ectopic%20heterochromatin%20formation%20genome)*. Although “activation domain” suggests recruitment of transcriptional machinery, its role here is to keep chromatin in a permissive state at the onset of heterochromatin formation. In fact, Sorida et al. showed that this N-terminal domain (independent of the JmjC region) is required to suppress *de novo* ectopic heterochromatin formation[*\[43\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=processes%20warrant%20further%20investigation,stochastic%20ectopic%20heterochromatin%20formation%20genome)*[\[13\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Epe1%20prevented%20deposition%20of%20ectopic,provided%20a%20basis%20for%20epigenetic)* – likely by facilitating some transcription or chromatin opening that precludes H3K9 methylation deposition.  
* **Role in RNAi and Transcription of Repeats:** Paradoxically, Epe1 has been implicated in *promoting* heterochromatin formation at repeats by ensuring their transcription. At pericentromeric repeats (dg/dh repeats), Epe1 overproduction increases RNA polymerase II occupancy and the expression of these noncoding RNAs[*\[42\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,). This may seem counterintuitive, but those transcripts are substrates for the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway which, in fission yeast, feeds back to deposit H3K9me and form heterochromatin. A recent study found that tandemly repeated genes require Epe1 to efficiently generate transcripts that trigger RNAi-dependent heterochromatin establishment[*\[45\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=View)*[\[46\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=promote%20RNA%20interference%20%28RNAi%29,the%20DNA%20sequence%20underlying%20constitutive)*. Epe1’s anti-silencing activity ensures enough transcripts are made from repeats, *without completely disrupting heterochromatin*, to engage the RNAi machinery and thereby **reinforce silencing in a regulated way***[\[46\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=promote%20RNA%20interference%20%28RNAi%29,the%20DNA%20sequence%20underlying%20constitutive). This underscores that Epe1’s function is a nuanced balancing act: it **destabilizes heterochromatin locally to allow transcription or nucleosome turnover**, but this can ultimately facilitate the controlled assembly or inheritance of heterochromatin by providing RNAi signals[*\[45\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=View)*[\[46\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=promote%20RNA%20interference%20%28RNAi%29,the%20DNA%20sequence%20underlying%20constitutive)*. Such a mechanism is clearly non-enzymatic; it involves Epe1’s role as a chromatin-bound factor affecting polymerase access and RNA production.  
* **Evolutionary and Functional Analogies:** Epe1 is one of several examples where a chromatin-modifying enzyme homolog has evolved a non-catalytic role. For instance, fruit fly KDM4A (a demethylase) can modulate heterochromatin structure even when its enzymatic activity is inactivated[*\[47\]*](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Bao%20and%20Jia%203%20interactions,19)*[\[22\]](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Concluding%20Remarks%20In%20summary%2C%20our,modifying%20enzymes%20contributes%20to%20disease)*. Similarly, mammalian UTX (an H3K27 demethylase) can activate enhancers by recruiting other co-factors, independent of its demethylase activity[*\[48\]*](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=activity%20is%20dispensable%20for%20complex,Other%20Chromatin%02Modifying%20Enzymes%20Overexpressed%20in)*[\[49\]](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=modulates%20enhancer%20activation%20by%20recruiting,methyltrans%02ferase%2C%20is%20overexpressed%20in%20highly)*. These analogies, noted by Bao & Jia (2019), bolster the interpretation that Epe1 is primarily a **scaffolding or recruiting protein**, not a chemical catalyst[*\[22\]*](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Concluding%20Remarks%20In%20summary%2C%20our,modifying%20enzymes%20contributes%20to%20disease). In other words, nature often repurposes these JmjC proteins as chromatin-binding modules with regulatory influence, which is how many in the field now view Epe1[*\[22\]*](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Concluding%20Remarks%20In%20summary%2C%20our,modifying%20enzymes%20contributes%20to%20disease).

**Potential weaknesses or opposing points:** The non-enzymatic model is strongly supported by most data, but a few observations suggest Epe1’s JmjC domain *does* make a difference in certain scenarios:

* Sorida et al. (2019) argue that **full heterochromatin disruption** at an ectopic site *eventually* required Epe1’s JmjC domain–dependent demethylation, as the N-terminal anti-silencing activity alone could not completely erase H3K9me[*\[14\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=canonical%20JmjC%20mutant%2C%20suppressed%20red,domain%20mediated%20removal%20of%20H3K9me)*[\[13\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Epe1%20prevented%20deposition%20of%20ectopic,provided%20a%20basis%20for%20epigenetic)*. This indicates that while Epe1’s non-catalytic functions prevent and erode heterochromatin to a large extent, the residual methyl marks might be cleared (or “proofread”) by an enzymatic step. However, it’s worth noting this conclusion was drawn from *in vivo* behavior, and the actual catalytic action is inferred, not directly observed. It remains possible that the JmjC domain contributes to heterochromatin removal in a structural capacity (e.g. binding a demethylase from elsewhere or stabilizing a particular complex) rather than via Epe1’s own enzymatic activity.  
* There is no known *alternative enzyme* that Epe1 recruits for H3K9 demethylation in fission yeast (no other H3K9 demethylase exists in the organism’s genome). Thus, if H3K9me is indeed actively removed in an Epe1-dependent manner *in vivo*, it suggests Epe1 could have a low intrinsic demethylase activity that is not detected in vitro, or that the in vivo context (chromatin structure, other co-factors) is needed to license its activity. This is a lingering question: the **non-enzymatic model does not yet fully explain how H3K9me marks are erased** in Epe1’s presence, especially during events like heterochromatin resetting after mitosis or after removal of tethered Clr4[*\[12\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=heterochromatin%20formation%20on%20heterochromatin%20assembly,ectopic%20heterochromatin%20is%20not%20known)*[\[50\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=studies%20suggest%20that%20Epe1%20targets,ectopic%20heterochromatin%20is%20not%20known)*. It explains the *prevention* of spreading (via blocking positive feedback loops), but complete removal of a pre-existing methyl mark might still require some enzymatic step.

Despite these nuances, the consensus of recent studies is that Epe1’s primary mode of action is **through binding and recruitment, not demethylation***[\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions)*[\[22\]](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Concluding%20Remarks%20In%20summary%2C%20our,modifying%20enzymes%20contributes%20to%20disease)*. The JmjC domain of Epe1 appears to function as a protein–protein interaction module (and possibly a regulated one at that), rather than as an active demethylase enzyme[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions)*[\[51\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%5E%7B434,100%20Figure%203%E2%80%94figure)*.

## Comparative Analysis of Models

To clearly contrast the two models of Epe1 function, the table below summarizes key experimental evidence, noting whether each piece supports the **Histone Demethylase** model, the **Non-enzymatic/Boundary** model, or both, and the relative strength of the evidence:

| Evidence (Method) | Observation | Supports Demethylase Model? | Supports Non-enzymatic Model? | Evidence Strength | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **JmjC domain homology** (sequence analysis) | Epe1 has a JmjC domain (typical demethylase fold). | Yes – suggests potential H3K9 demethylase activity. | No – homology alone is not functional proof; Epe1 lacks key catalytic residues. | Inferential (weak on its own). | JmjC motif in Epe1[*\[4\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=The%20JmjC%20domain%20is%20conserved,euchromatin%20boundaries%20%5B11%E2%80%9314%5D.%20The); missing Fe(II)-binding residues[*\[18\]*](https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/9Q2YaKn7/#:~:text=Interaction%20of%20Epe1%20With%20the,that%20Swi6%20recruits%20Epe1). |
| **In vitro demethylation assay** (mass spectrometry) | Purified Epe1 *fails* to demethylate H3K9me2/3 peptides (even with HP1 added). | No – directly contradicts enzymatic activity. | Yes – indicates Epe1 likely acts via other means. | **Strong direct** biochemical evidence. | Raiymbek 2020[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions). |

| **Epe1 deletion phenotype** (genetics, ChIP) | *epe1Δ* causes gene silencing to spread (variegation), higher H3K9me at new sites, and can maintain heterochromatin without RNAi. | Yes – absence of demethylase would allow unchecked methylation spreading. | Yes – absence of boundary factor allows heterochromatin to expand. | Moderate (in vivo, consistent with both models). | Zofall 2006[*\[42\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,); Epe1 represses H3K9me “islands”[*\[10\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20suggest%20genome,release%20of%20tethered%20Clr4%2C%20the). |
| **Catalytic-site mutant** (H297A in JmjC) – variegation assay | Epe1-H297A (no demethylase activity) still suppresses silencing (prevents variegation) similarly to wild-type Epe1. | No – demethylase activity not required for this anti-silencing effect. | Yes – supports a non-catalytic mechanism for anti-silencing. | **Strong** (genetic test of function). | Sorida 2019[*\[14\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=canonical%20JmjC%20mutant%2C%20suppressed%20red,domain%20mediated%20removal%20of%20H3K9me); Bao 2019[*\[19\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/33/1-2/116.full.pdf#:~:text=,344205). |
| **Established heterochromatin removal** (Clr4 tether & release, or complementation assay) | Epe1 is required to fully remove H3K9me from pre-established ectopic heterochromatin. JmjC-mutant Epe1 cannot efficiently erase existing marks. | Yes – indicates a JmjC-dependent demethylation function in vivo. | Partially – non-enzymatic functions aren’t sufficient for complete removal, implying JmjC’s involvement (possibly catalytic). | Strong (in vivo demonstration of JmjC-dependent mark removal, though indirect for catalysis). | Artificial heterochromatin disruption[*\[12\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=heterochromatin%20formation%20on%20heterochromatin%20assembly,ectopic%20heterochromatin%20is%20not%20known); Sorida 2019[*\[13\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Epe1%20prevented%20deposition%20of%20ectopic,provided%20a%20basis%20for%20epigenetic). |
| **Epe1–Swi6 (HP1) interaction** (co-IP, pull-down) | Epe1 binds HP1 (Swi6) directly; binding is H3K9me-dependent. | No – binding is a protein interaction, not related to catalysis. | Yes – supports model of Epe1 being recruited to heterochromatin via HP1 to exert structural effects. | Strong (direct molecular interaction). | Epe1–Swi6 direct binding[*\[27\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=two%20C,we%20tested%20the%20interaction%20between)*[\[30\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=putative%20catalytic%20JmjC%20domain%20of,of%20epigenetic%20complexes%20in%20cells)*. |
| **Epe1 recruits SAGA (HAT complex)** (affinity purification & mass spec) | Epe1 co-purifies with SAGA; Epe1 overexpression brings HAT activity to silent loci, increasing histone acetylation and gene expression. | No – heterochromatin relief is achieved by acetylation, not by methyl removal. | Yes – demonstrates Epe1’s role as a scaffold recruiting anti-silencing enzymatic activities. | **Strong direct** (biochemical and functional link). | Bao 2019[*\[33\]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6317313/#:~:text=,acetylation%2C%20transcription%20of%20repeats%2C)*[\[31\]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,)*. |
| **Epe1–Bdf2 interaction** (ChIP, IP) | Epe1 recruits bromodomain protein Bdf2 to heterochromatin boundaries; Bdf2 binds acetylated histones to block spread. | No – effect is via reader/acetylation, not demethylation. | Yes – indicates Epe1 establishes a chromatin boundary through protein recruitment. | Strong (direct ChIP localization and interaction data). | Wang 2013[*\[34\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/27/17/1886.full.html#:~:text=Bdf2%20is%20enriched%20at%20IRCs,H4%20tails%20and%20antagonize). |
| **Histone deacetylase competition** (tethering assay) | An isolated Epe1 C-terminus (no JmjC) can prevent heterochromatin establishment by outcompeting HDAC Clr3 at Swi6 binding sites. | No – this fragment has no enzymatic function, yet still blocks silencing. | Yes – provides a mechanistic basis: Epe1’s physical presence on HP1 blocks silencing enzymes. | **Strong direct** (targeted functional assay). | Raiymbek 2020[*\[36\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=epe1%CE%94%20cells,10X%20tetO%20ade6)*[\[37\]](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=cells%20that%20harbor%2010X%20TetO,Error%20bars%20represent%20standard)*. |
| **In vivo histone turnover** (micrococcal nuclease mapping) | Epe1 increases nucleosome turnover in heterochromatic regions (more histone replacement). | Possibly – accelerated replacement could indirectly assist removal of methylated histones (similar outcome to demethylation). | Yes – consistent with a role in making heterochromatin less stable, via non-enzymatic chromatin dynamics. | Moderate (supports mechanism indirectly). | Bao 2019 (as cited in Raiymbek 2020[*\[35\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=nucleosome%20turnover%20%28Bao%20et%20al,to%C2%A0these%20recent%20studies%20and%20expand)). |

**Table Legend:** Evidence marked **strong direct** comes from experiments that directly test Epe1’s biochemical activity or physical role (e.g. enzymatic assays, protein complex identification, targeted recruitment assays). **Moderate or indirect** evidence includes genetic and phenotypic observations that support a model but could be explained by multiple mechanisms. As seen above, most of the *direct* evidence favors the non-catalytic (boundary factor) model, whereas the demethylase model is supported primarily by genetic evidence and homology, rather than by direct biochemical demonstration.

## Conclusion

Recent research converges on the view that **Epe1 functions predominantly as a non-enzymatic regulator of heterochromatin**, rather than as a bona fide H3K9 demethylase[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions)*[\[22\]](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Concluding%20Remarks%20In%20summary%2C%20our,modifying%20enzymes%20contributes%20to%20disease)*. The strongest experimental support – from *in vitro* enzymatic tests, protein interaction mapping, and live-cell chromatin assays – indicates that Epe1 counteracts heterochromatin by **binding to HP1 and recruiting chromatin-modifying activities (like histone acetylation and remodeling)** to methylated regions[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions)*[\[33\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6317313/#:~:text=,acetylation%2C%20transcription%20of%20repeats%2C)*. Through these interactions, Epe1 creates a negative feedback on heterochromatin: it makes silent domains more fluid (high turnover) and locally enriched in histone acetylation, thereby impeding the spread and stability of H3K9 methylation[*\[6\]*](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Epe1-associates-with-SAGA-A-Mass-spectrometry-analyses-of-purified-protein-complexes_fig1_329820574#:~:text=,of%20bistable%20heterochromatic%20regions%3F)*[\[2\]](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Cul4,state%20at%20centromeres%2C%20indicating%20that)*.

By contrast, the **histone demethylase model** of Epe1, while once an appealing explanation for its anti-silencing effects, has **not been corroborated by direct biochemical evidence***[\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions). Instead, mutations disabling the putative demethylase active site often do not abolish Epe1’s function in vivo[*\[14\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=canonical%20JmjC%20mutant%2C%20suppressed%20red,domain%20mediated%20removal%20of%20H3K9me), and no measurable H3K9me removal by Epe1 has been observed in purified systems[*\[5\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%20in%20the%20presence%20and,activate%20its%20putative%20enzymatic%20functions). It is still possible that Epe1’s JmjC domain contributes some enzymatic activity under specific cellular conditions (or that it works in tandem with other factors to achieve demethylation in vivo)[*\[13\]*](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008129#:~:text=Epe1%20prevented%20deposition%20of%20ectopic,provided%20a%20basis%20for%20epigenetic). However, if such activity exists, it is likely weak and secondary. The prevailing model is that **Epe1’s JmjC domain serves a structural role** – for instance, regulating Epe1’s conformation or binding partners (such as Swi6) – rather than acting as a classic enzyme[*\[51\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=Epe1%5E%7B434,100%20Figure%203%E2%80%94figure).

In summary, Epe1 emerges as a vital *anti-silencing hub* in fission yeast: it sits at the interface of heterochromatin and euchromatin, reading the state of histone modifications and orchestrating appropriate responses. Whether by recruiting histone acetylases (SAGA)[*\[33\]*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6317313/#:~:text=,acetylation%2C%20transcription%20of%20repeats%2C), bromodomain readers (Bdf2)[*\[34\]*](https://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/27/17/1886.full.html#:~:text=Bdf2%20is%20enriched%20at%20IRCs,H4%20tails%20and%20antagonize), or simply by physically barring silencers (Clr3 HDAC) from their docking sites[*\[36\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=epe1%CE%94%20cells,10X%20tetO%20ade6), Epe1 ensures that heterochromatin formation is kept in check and can be reversed when needed. This safeguards the plasticity of epigenetic states. While the histone demethylase model spurred much initial research, it is the **alternative models of Epe1 as a chromatin boundary factor and anti-silencing protein** that are most strongly supported by the current body of evidence. Future studies (e.g. higher-resolution structural analysis of Epe1’s domains, or reconstitution of Epe1’s activity on nucleosomes) will further clarify whether Epe1 retains any latent enzymatic function or if it is an archetypal example of a **“reader-like” regulator evolved from an enzyme family***[\[29\]*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53155#:~:text=paradigm%20where%20a%20putative%20histone,regulate%20the%20assembly%20of%20epigenetic)*[\[22\]](https://jia.biology.columbia.edu/sites/jia.biology.columbia.edu/files/content/publicatons/2019_EpiInsights_Bao.pdf#:~:text=Concluding%20Remarks%20In%20summary%2C%20our,modifying%20enzymes%20contributes%20to%20disease)*.
