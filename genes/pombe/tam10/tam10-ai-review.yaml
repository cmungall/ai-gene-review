  label: Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-
description: 'Uncharacterized protein identified through proteogenomic screening, named for its altered transcript levels during meiosis. tam10 is a sequence orphan with no identifiable protein domains or orthologs outside the fission yeast lineage. Despite meiotic upregulation, deletion mutants show no phenotype under standard conditions, suggesting a subtle, condition-specific, or redundant function.'

  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000015
  review:
    summary: 'This is a root biological process term with ND (No Data) evidence, used as a placeholder when no specific biological process is known. This annotation accurately reflects the current state of knowledge for tam10, which has no experimentally determined biological function despite being identified as having altered meiotic expression [PMID:21270388]. The meiotic expression change alone is insufficient to assign a specific biological process without functional data.'
    action: ACCEPT
    reason: 'The ND annotation for biological_process is appropriate given the complete lack of functional characterization. While tam10 shows differential expression during meiosis [PMID:21270388], this correlative observation does not justify assignment to meiotic processes without direct functional evidence. The deletion phenotype shows no defects in growth, viability, or sporulation, consistent with unknown function.'

    label: RNA binding
  evidence_type: ISO
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: 'This RNA binding annotation is based on orthology transfer (ISO) from human KNOP1 (UniProtKB:Q1ED39). However, bioinformatics analysis reveals only 16.7% sequence identity between tam10 and KNOP1, well below orthology thresholds. tam10 is described as a "sequence orphan" with no clear orthologs [PMID:21270388], making orthology-based transfer invalid. The similarity appears to be compositional (both lysine-rich) rather than evolutionary.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'The ISO evidence is invalid because tam10 has no established orthologs. Bitton et al. (2011) classified tam10 and similar genes as having no detectable conservation even in other fungi. Our bioinformatics analysis confirms only 16.7% identity to KNOP1, far below typical ortholog thresholds (>25-30%). The proteins share compositional features (high lysine content) but lack sequence homology. The ISO annotation appears to be an error based on superficial similarity rather than true orthology.'

    label: nucleolus
  evidence_type: ISS
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000024
  review:
    summary: 'This nucleolus localization annotation is based on sequence similarity (ISS) to human KNOP1 (UniProtKB:Q1ED39). However, our analysis shows tam10 has only 16.7% identity to KNOP1, insufficient for reliable similarity-based inference. tam10 lacks any recognizable domains, targeting signals, or valid orthologs that would support this localization transfer.'
    action: REMOVE
    reason: 'The ISS evidence is unfounded as tam10 has minimal sequence similarity to KNOP1 (16.7% identity). Bitton et al. (2011) found no conserved domains or motifs in tam10. The similarity to KNOP1 appears to be compositional (both lysine-rich) rather than based on conserved localization signals. Without valid sequence similarity or experimental data, this nucleolar annotation is speculative. The subcellular localization of tam10 remains completely unknown.'
