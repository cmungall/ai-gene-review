  label: Schizosaccharomyces pombe
description: 'Gpd3 is the minor isoform of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in S. pombe, catalyzing the reversible NAD+-dependent oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in glycolysis. While its paralog Tdh1 handles bulk glycolytic flux, Gpd3 shows evidence of moonlighting functions including stress response signaling, transcriptional regulation through RNA Pol II interaction, and RNA processing via splicing factor association. The protein is extensively post-translationally modified and functions within a stable glycolytic metabolon.'

suggested_experiments:
- experiment_type: Protein-protein interaction
  hypothesis: Test if Gpd3 interacts with Hsp70 or Hsp90 chaperones in S. pombe (NOTE - this is highly speculative based on mammalian GAPDH data only)
  description: Co-immunoprecipitation of Gpd3 with Hsp70/Hsp90 under normal and stress conditions. This tests the controversial hypothesis that Gpd3 might have chaperone-related functions like mammalian GAPDH, though there is currently NO evidence for this in S. pombe.
- experiment_type: Protein aggregation assay
  hypothesis: Test if Gpd3 affects protein aggregation under stress (HIGHLY SPECULATIVE - based solely on distant ortholog data)
  description: Monitor protein aggregation in gpd3Δ vs WT under heat shock or oxidative stress using fluorescent aggregation reporters. This would test whether Gpd3 has any role in protein homeostasis, though this function is unvalidated in fungi.
- experiment_type: Heme binding assay
  hypothesis: Test if Gpd3 can bind heme like mammalian GAPDH (EXTREMELY SPECULATIVE)
  description: In vitro heme binding assays with purified Gpd3 protein. Mammalian GAPDH acts as a heme chaperone (PMID:30012884), but this moonlighting function may not be conserved across such evolutionary distance.
- experiment_type: Stress phenotyping
  hypothesis: Test if gpd3Δ shows sensitivity to proteotoxic stress
  description: Growth assays of gpd3Δ under conditions causing protein misfolding (heat shock, DTT, tunicamycin). Would reveal if Gpd3 contributes to protein quality control, though current evidence is lacking.
- experiment_type: Subcellular localization
  hypothesis: Test nuclear translocation of Gpd3 under various conditions
  description: Live-cell imaging of Gpd3-GFP under oxidative stress, heat shock, or transcriptional stress to confirm potential nuclear moonlighting functions suggested by RNA Pol II interaction.
