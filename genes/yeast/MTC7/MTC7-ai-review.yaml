description: 'MTC7 (Maintenance of telomere capping protein 7) is a small membrane protein with two transmembrane helices and an exceptionally charged C-terminal domain containing 8 consecutive lysines. Identified through genetic screens as a suppressor of cdc13-1 temperature-sensitive phenotype, MTC7 contributes to telomere maintenance pathways. The protein exhibits unusual structural features suggesting potential membrane-nuclear shuttling capabilities, with its C-terminal polybasic tract serving as a strong nuclear localization signal while the transmembrane domains anchor it to cellular membranes.'

  evidence_type: IEA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000120
  review:
    summary: 'This annotation is supported by bioinformatics analysis confirming two transmembrane helices at positions 13-33 and 42-62. The protein shows Type II membrane topology with both N- and C-termini in the cytoplasm.'

  review:
    summary: 'This is a placeholder annotation indicating no known molecular function. Based on genetic evidence showing involvement in telomere capping and the presence of a strong C-terminal polybasic tract, the protein likely has DNA-binding or protein-binding activities related to telomere maintenance.'
