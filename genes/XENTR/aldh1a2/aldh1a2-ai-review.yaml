description: Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) that catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of retinaldehyde to all-trans retinoic acid (RA), the bioactive vitamin A metabolite. Essential enzyme in the retinoic acid biosynthetic pathway that controls spatiotemporal RA production during embryonic development. Critical for posterior body axis patterning, heart morphogenesis, limb bud initiation, and organogenesis. In adult tissues, contributes to immune regulation and tissue homeostasis.

- term:
    id: GO:0004029
    label: aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) activity
  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: This is a valid annotation based on phylogenetic inference. ALDH1A2 belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family and contains conserved NAD-binding domain and catalytic residues. However, the more specific term GO:0001758 (retinal dehydrogenase activity) better captures the enzyme's substrate specificity.

  evidence_type: IBA
  original_reference_id: GO_REF:0000033
  review:
    summary: While technically correct (ALDH1A2 does metabolize aldehydes), this term is too general. The enzyme specifically metabolizes retinaldehyde to retinoic acid, which is better captured by GO:0002138 (retinoic acid biosynthetic process).

  review:
    summary: This is the core molecular function of ALDH1A2. The enzyme specifically catalyzes the oxidation of retinaldehyde to retinoic acid using NAD+ as a cofactor. This function is well-established across vertebrates and supported by extensive biochemical and genetic evidence.

  review:
    summary: This is an overly general parent term. While ALDH1A2 is indeed an oxidoreductase, the more specific term GO:0001758 (retinal dehydrogenase activity) should be used instead.
