description: Isopenicillin-N N-acyltransferase (IAT) that catalyzes the final step in penicillin biosynthesis. The enzyme exchanges the α-aminoadipyl side chain of isopenicillin N for phenylacetic acid to produce penicillin G. Functions as a self-processing enzyme that is initially synthesized as a 40 kDa precursor and undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to form an active heterodimer containing 11 kDa and 29 kDa subunits. Located in the peroxisomal matrix where penicillin biosynthesis occurs.
