description: 'CG6051 encodes the Drosophila ortholog of human ZFYVE28/LST2 (Lateral Signaling Target protein 2), a FYVE zinc finger domain-containing protein that localizes to early endosomes via PI3P binding. Functions as a molecular adaptor in growth factor signaling, specifically in the negative regulation of EGFR signaling pathway. The protein is phosphorylated by mTORC1 and mediates feedback inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Contains a C-terminal FYVE domain (residues 909-969) that coordinates two zinc ions and targets the protein to endosomal membranes.'
